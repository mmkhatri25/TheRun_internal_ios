Eurgh!

00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Fuck.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Nonna!

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Nonna!

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Ok...

Fuck!

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,479
Jesus Christ!

16
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,919
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

17
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah, well, I didn't.

19
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,639
Put the fucking knife away.

20
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,639
Right...

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,919
<i>One new video message </i>

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Matteo, slow down a sec.

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,680
- Zan!
- Hey Zanna!

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,039
So we are 
walking home.

25
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,560
I didn't get the tattoo in 
the end, but guess what?

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,039
I got this instead...

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,639
Sexy as fuck.

28
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,520
Right?

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
So listen, I 
just wanna say -

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
I love you.

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,039
Even though I never get 
to see you anymore because

32
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,479
you're, I don't know, 
busy breaking the internet.

33
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,280
But...

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
... you deserve that success.

35
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,800
- Tell her.
- You do, you really do.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Stay on the grind, sis!

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
Oh, and no hard feelings 
about the money.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,479
Tough love, like, I get it.

40
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,080
[laughs]

41
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,439
Who's the party boy?

42
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,039
My brother, Cliff.

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,080
You know the type.

45
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,039
He'll go far.

46
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,520
... and you aren't positive?

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
No, I am when I 
need to be.

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,159
Your earphones stayed in?

50
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,840
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,879
I'm the brand's ambassador.

52
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,680
I get five figures 
every time I say

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,479
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

54
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,879
Nice.

55
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,800
Nonna!

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,199
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

57
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,000
You trying to 
get us killed?!

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Sorry.
