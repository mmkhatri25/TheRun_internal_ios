1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:07,960
Come on.

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's lock him in.

3
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,640
The toll woman usually 
stands outside this hut.

4
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
- Yeah, well, not today.
- [phone pings]

5
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
Unopened video message 
from Clifford Hendricks.

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,519
Zanna... 
Zanna, oh my God...

7
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,920
Cliff's been in an accident.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
We were attacked 
and he defended me,

9
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,480
but they beat 
him up really bad.

10
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,120
He didn't have any 
money for a taxi,

11
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,359
so, we were walking home
and these guys just like...

12
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,159
... they just like, 
jumped us.

13
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,840
They're taking him 
to the hospital.

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
They're gonna do 
an emergency operation.

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,439
These guys that attacked 
us, they were like sickos.

16
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,200
They wore like these, 
I don't know...

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,000
... these skull masks.

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,719
Oh my god.

19
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,719
Fuck.

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Fuck!

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,239
Zanna...

22
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,240
No.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,759
My brother.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,439
My baby brother...

25
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,159
Shit...

26
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,400
This is all my fault.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,199
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

28
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,599
I was trying to 
teach him a lesson.

29
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,000
... and he will learn.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,960
We're nearly in Libitina.

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,360
You can go to him.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
[heavy breath]

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
What if it's too late?

34
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,520
Zanna! Can you hear that?

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,360
[distant church bell]

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
There is life in Libitina.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Here.

38
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,159
Come on. It's okay.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,759
Let's go.

40
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,840
[distant church bell]

41
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,280
[distant church bell]

42
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,439
[church bell ringing]

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

44
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,120
We need to warn them.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

46
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,759
<i>and women</i>

47
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,800
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

48
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,439
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

49
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,039
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

50
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,759
[doors opening]

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

52
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,800
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

53
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,480
<i>The final purification</i>

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,759
Matteo...

56
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,959
Nonna?

57
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,720
Matteo, wait!
