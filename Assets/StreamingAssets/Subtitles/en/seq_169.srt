<i>This...</i>

My brave boy.

What the fuck 
is going on?!

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
From what I can see, 
which is not a lot,

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
it's really beautiful!

17
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,840
But let me tell you...

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
These mountain 
roads are crazy.

00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>In this moment,</i>

27
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,400
<i>you are on a middle plane.</i>

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>A place which offers salvation </i>

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes!

00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,640

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,879
I ran...

51
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
... and I shouldn't have run.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,319
You're a good person, Zanna.

53
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,919
You've done enough 
to be saved.

Please take it.

Come on...

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
My beautiful baby brother.

65
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,600
You were right.

Wake up!

73
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,519
I am going to give you one
last motivational speech

74
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,040
So, you listen to me.

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,920
You keep fighting, ok?

[tearful]
Keep fighting!

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,879
Because you need more time 
to spread your amazing energy.

78
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,879
So just keep, keep going.

79
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,240
Keep fighting... for me.

00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,879
Please... because I love you.
