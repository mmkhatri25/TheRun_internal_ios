1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,679
Ok.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's get out of here.

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,320
[gasping]

4
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,880
<i>One new video message </i>
<i>from 'Clifford Hendricks'.</i>

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,960
Matteo, slow down a sec.

6
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,520
- Zan!
- Hey Zanna!

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,880
So we are 
walking home.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,399
I didn't get the tattoo in 
the end, but guess what?

9
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,880
I got this instead...

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,479
Sexy as fuck.

11
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,359
Right?

12
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,519
So listen, I 
just wanna say -

13
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,920
I love you.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,879
Even though I never get 
to see you anymore because

15
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,319
you're, I don't know, 
busy breaking the internet.

16
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,120
But...

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,439
... you deserve that success.

18
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,640
- Tell her.
- You do, you really do.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,359
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,640
Stay on the grind, sis!

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,959
Oh, and no hard feelings 
about the money.

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,319
Tough love, like, I get it.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,920
[laughs]

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280
Who's the party boy?

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,879
My brother, Cliff.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,400
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,920
You know the type.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,879
He'll go far.

29
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,359
... and you aren't positive?

30
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,359
No, I am when I 
need to be.

31
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,359
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

32
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,000
Your earphones stayed in?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,719
I'm the brand's ambassador.

35
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,519
I get five figures 
every time I say

36
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,319
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,719
Nice.

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,639
Nonna!

39
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,039
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

40
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,840
You trying to 
get us killed?!

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Sorry.
