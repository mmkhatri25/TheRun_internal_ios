00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,759
[sighs]

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,320
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,919
Hi.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,080
Can I give 
you a hand?

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
Thanks.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,920
Where?

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,760
Over there.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
♪ Italian music playing ♪

9
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,000
- Okay. 
- Thank you.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,160
You're welcome.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,960
But you are 
not from Libitina.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,520
[laughs]
How did you guess?

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,920
No, I'm just passing through.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,600
Your village is very beautiful.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
We people stay beautiful too.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
Mm.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,320
All live here 80, 90, 100 years!

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,799
I heard.

19
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,079
So, tell me, 
what's your secret?

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,359
Is it the great olive oil, 
the good wine?

21
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,359
Simple.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,759
We live for each other 
and respect the land.

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,600
When you run, 
you will see.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,200
We care for nature
and buildings from our past.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,519
A real sense of community.

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,760
Yes.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
But I have another 
little secret...

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
We make love every day.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
[laughs]

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,439
More or less.
[chuckles]

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,799
Okay.

32
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,719
I'll save some bottles
if you survive your trail.

33
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,719
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

34
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,760
- Take care.
- Take care.

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,319
[phone ringing]

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Zan!

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,640
Oh my god.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,040
Yo, guess what?

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,239
I just popped a Xan, 
and now I am talking to--

40
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,239
What is it, Cliff?
I'm running.

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
I thought you were
kickboxing in Thailand?

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,519
No.

43
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,239
That finished two weeks ago, 
and it was muay thai.

44
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,519
Keep up, Cliff.

45
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,280
Right, so where 
are you now?

46
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,479
Italy.

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,319
Thought I'd take a
pit stop on the way home.

48
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,400
[laughs]

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Slow down.
Burnout's a real thing.

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
[buzzing noise]
What's that noise?

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,719
Is that a tattoo gun?!

52
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,800
Yeah, so what do you 
think would look better?

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,680
Um.

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,360
Tribal? Arabic?

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,199
Cliff, you're wasted.

56
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,080
You are gonna be paying 
penance with your life

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,280
if you get a tattoo. Mom 
and Dad are going to kill you.

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,680
There's that trusty
Catholic guilt-tripping again.

59
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,199
Relax. Jocelyn's the 
only one getting one.

60
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,400
Who's Jocelyn?

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
- A girl.
- No shit.

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Don't get her name tattooed...

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,280
or mine... or yours, 
for that matter.

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Joce is a huge 
fan, by the way.

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Say 'hi', babe.

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
[gasps] 
Oh my god...

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,319
Zanna, you kicked ass 
in Thailand, queen.

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,159
Thanks.

69
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,479
I've got a new 'Run
Diary' dropping tonight.

70
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,479
Oh, bet. 
I'll be watching.

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,719
[laughs]

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,639
Do you use 
me to get girls?

73
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,319
- Of course.
- Hey! Shut up!

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,319
Ok.

75
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,080
Um.

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,439
So, is that why 
you called me?

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,960
No.

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,520
So, just give 
me one sec.

79
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,439
Ok, I'll be right 
back, babe.

80
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,639
Stay strong.

81
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,319
Those stars are so unique.

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,960
Could you wire 
me some cash?

83
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
Shit's a little 
expensive out here.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,159
You mean drugs 
are expensive.

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,599
Cliff, you're supposed 
to be studying.

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
Well, I'm nailing 
my grades anyway.

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,479
Come on, Zan.
Life's to be lived, you know?

88
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,560
We're all going 
to die someday.

89
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
- Would you rather--
- Save it.

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
Ok, so... the cash?

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,360
[sighs]

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,840
I mean... I promise...
I'll never ask again.

93
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
It's just so I can 
get through this date.

94
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,919
Please.
