1
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,839
You go.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,200
I'll catch you up.

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,720
Guys, this is 
now a mass murder.

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,879
Zanna.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
What?

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
This is a crime scene. 
It's evidence.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,519
You don't have to present 
it like it's entertainment.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
You always wanted 
to be a vlogger?

9
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,640
Not exactly.

10
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,560
I was a really 
good youth runner,

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,880
but I wasn't the best.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,079
What?

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,640
... and you need 
to be the best?

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,239
Yeah, of course.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
So, I pivoted to
online health and fitness.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,120
Now I'm just a few million followers
away from being the best.

17
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,200
Must take a lot of discipline 
to film your every move.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah, good Catholic discipline.

19
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,719
You're Catholic too?

20
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,560
Not so much now, but 
the discipline was instilled

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,120
- in me at a young age.
- By who?

22
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,879
Sorry, you probably
told me all this last night,

23
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,359
but I don't remember a thing.

24
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,079
Didn't realize I 
got that wasted.

25
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,680
Yeah, me either.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Although, I have an excuse.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,560
Jet lag and a six and a
half hour drive to get here.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
So, you're a 
role model, huh?

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,879
[laughs]

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,120
I guess.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,400
It feels weird 
saying that out loud.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,200
But I've never really understood 
why somebody would follow

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,319
somebody who can do
something that they can't.

34
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,920
But it is what it is, and if I 
don't do it, somebody else will.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Well, keep going.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Someday you might be able
to retire out here in Libitina.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
[laughs]
Yeah.

38
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,280
So, what about you?

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,079
You're not into social media?

40
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,800
Nah, signal's shit out here.
There's no point.

41
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,599
Why don't you just leave?

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
You're too young to 
be here anyway.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,759
I chose to be here.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Yeah, but why?

45
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,800
Obligation to your grandparents?

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,599
No, I wanted 
to better myself.

47
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,039
Work on that Catholic discipline.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,759
Jesus, your nonna 
must have had

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
ankles of steel to 
run this every day.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So listen, this is 
slightly awkward but

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,599
are you so Catholic that
you didn't use a condom last night?

52
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,000
Uh...

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
I don't know.

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,159
Jesus, why can't 
we remember?

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,759
Who lives there?

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Just a crazy old guy.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,879
[gunshot]

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,159
Shit!

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,599
Oh god...

60
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,240
[gunshot]

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,159
Winchester 243.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,039
The rifle.

63
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,840
I can hear it.

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
It holds five rounds.

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,039
You've got a few 
seconds between shots.

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,879
[gunshot]

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,639
Go!

68
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:39,960
[gun reload]

69
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,280
Shit.

70
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,439
[gunshot]

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, whoa, whoa! 
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,639
I'm just a runner.

73
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,199
<i>Who did I shoot?</i>

74
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,079
<i>Tell me!</i>

75
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,680
I don't understand...

76
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,639
Uh...

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,839
American.

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,680
My friend... he's hurt.

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,800
He needs medicine.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Do you have 
any medicine?

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Ok...

82
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,759
[pained grunting]

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,920
Ah! <i>Che cazzo</i>!

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,519
Calm down.

85
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,279
<i>You're wasting 12 year old single malt</i>

86
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,199
<i>on a traitor and a coward.</i>

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,399
What did he say?

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
Just insults.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,560
I told you he's crazy.

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,079
<i>You're lucky my bullet </i>
<i>skimmed past you.</i>

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,759
[pained chuckle]

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,480
Tell him-- listen.

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,759
Next, I'll pull that 
bolt out of you--

94
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,560
No.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,079
<i>It's pierced my lung.</i>

96
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,160
<i>I'll suffocate on my own </i>
<i>blood if you pull it out.</i>

97
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,959
<i>What happened to you?</i>

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,040
<i>I was leaving for a morning hunt...</i>

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,839
He says an attacker shot him 
and left him to die like an animal.

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Which one was it?

101
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,920
<i>What colour was their mask?</i>

102
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,680
<i>It was...</i>

103
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,439
<i>... white like bone.</i>

104
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,480
Do you have a landline? 
A telephone that

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,399
we can call for help?

106
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>They cut the phone line.</i>

107
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,319
<i>The hunter became </i>
<i>the hunted.</i>

108
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,439
<i>I'm going to </i>
<i>die a cliche...</i>

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,000
<i>... but I've got one bullet </i>
<i>left for that bastard.</i>

110
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,879
<b>One bullet is enough.</b>

111
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,360
<i>You are from Libitina.</i>

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,360
<i>Everyone here knows </i>
<i>how to beat death.</i>

113
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,920
<i>Trust someone who served </i>
<i>this country for 40 years.</i>

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>The reaper comes </i>
<i>for us all.</i>

115
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,439
<i>No matter how </i>
<i>fast or far...</i>

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,800
<i>... you run.</i>

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
Ok, listen.
Tell him...

118
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,879
When we get back to Libitina, 
we're going to send help. Ok?

119
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,000
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait. You can't leave him.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,160
What are you talking about?
He doesn't want our help.

121
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,480
But it's wrong.

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,839
It's wrong?!

123
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,160
He's got a gun.

124
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,480
Better in here 
than out there.

125
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
He's got a gun 
with one bullet.

126
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,079
Better than none.
