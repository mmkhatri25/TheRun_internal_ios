00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:07,919
Nonna!

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Nonna!

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,039
[branch crunch]

4
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,239
Nonna!

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,480
[shuts door]

6
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,079
[breaths of relief]

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,399
Ok...

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,079
[gasping]

9
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,799
[engine flooding]

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
[engine flooding]

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Fuck!

12
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,359
Jesus Christ!

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,799
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

14
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,439
Yeah, well, I didn't.

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,520
Put the fucking knife away.

17
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Right...

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
<i>One new video message </i>
<i>from 'Clifford Hendricks'.</i>

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,879
Matteo, slow down a sec.

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,560
- Zan!
- Hey Zanna!

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,919
So we are 
walking home.

22
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,439
I didn't get the tattoo in 
the end, but guess what?

23
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,919
I got this instead...

24
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Sexy as fuck.

25
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,400
Right?

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
So listen, I 
just wanna say -

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,960
I love you.

28
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,919
Even though I never get 
to see you anymore because

29
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,360
you're, I don't know, 
busy breaking the internet.

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,159
But...

31
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,479
... you deserve that success.

32
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,680
- Tell her.
- You do, you really do.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,680
Stay on the grind, sis!

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, and no hard feelings 
about the money.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,360
Tough love, like, I get it.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,960
[laughs]

38
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,319
Who's the party boy?

39
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,919
My brother, Cliff.

40
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,439
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

41
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,960
You know the type.

42
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,919
He'll go far.

43
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,400
... and you aren't positive?

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
No, I am when I 
need to be.

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,039
Your earphones stayed in?

47
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,719
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

48
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,759
I'm the brand's ambassador.

49
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,560
I get five figures 
every time I say

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,360
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

51
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,759
Nice.

52
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,680
Nonna!

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,080
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,879
You trying to 
get us killed?!

55
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,159
Sorry.
