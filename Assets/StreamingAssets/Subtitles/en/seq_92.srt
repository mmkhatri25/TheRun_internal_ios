00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey!

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,719
[screams]

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,359
[strong impact]

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,160
[screams]

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,000
[grunting]

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,359
[screams]

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,159
[piercing sound]

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,359
[panting]

9
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,759
That was my nanno's.

10
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,560
Been busted for years.

11
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,879
Damn.

12
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,719
Is this him?

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Yeah.

14
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,359
They both gave 
their all for me.

15
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,439
Now I'm out here just
trying to do the same for them.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
A rosary?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,400
You're Catholic, huh?

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Mm-hm.

19
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,959
I'm a stronger believing
 now than before.

20
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,359
Really?

21
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,319
Put it on.

22
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,040
We need all the 
help we can get.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,519
We don't know how many
of those fuckers are out there.

24
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,879
Doesn't matter.

25
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,680
I'm finding my nonna.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,120
Do you always do
everything in those boots?

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,319
Pretty much.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm ex-army.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,359
Even running?

30
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,359
Yeah.

31
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,000
We'd run for miles in these.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Fair enough.

33
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,760
So, what route does
your 'nanna' usually take?

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,879
Well, there's no 'usual'.

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Sometimes she takes the
north trail, sometimes the south.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
She says 'hello' to
her friends in Libitina.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,520
Then she takes the other 
trail on the way back home.

38
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,240
So which trail 
did you take?

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,759
I took the north, but
there wasn't any sign of her.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then we'll take 
the south trail.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
So how long does 
she usually take?

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,599
Six hours.

43
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,400
She's fast for 85.

44
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,719
Jesus...

45
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,080
No wonder she features so 
heavily in your pillow talk.

46
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,120
- Down here. 
- Ok.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,240
So, how long ago 
did she leave?

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,960
I don't know.

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,319
She wasn't home when I 
got back from your place.

50
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,520
So, she could be 
anywhere on her route?

51
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,439
Jesus. As if things weren't
complicated enough already...

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Shit.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,639
What?

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,280
That's the car.

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,159
It looks abandoned.

56
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
Yeah well, 'looks' 
isn't good enough.

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,240
So, what do 
you want to do?
