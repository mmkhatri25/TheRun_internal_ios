00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,320
[phone ringing]

3
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,399
Zan!

4
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,640
Oh my god.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,039
Yo, guess what?

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,240
I just popped a Xan, 
and now I am talking to--

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
What is it, Cliff?
I'm running.

8
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,479
I thought you were
kickboxing in Thailand?

9
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,520
No.

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,240
That finished two weeks ago, 
and it was muay thai.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,520
Keep up, Cliff.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,280
Right, so where 
are you now?

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,479
Italy.

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,320
Thought I'd take a
pit stop on the way home.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,399
[laughs]

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,520
Slow down.
Burnout's a real thing.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,119
[buzzing noise]
What's that noise?

18
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,719
Is that a tattoo gun?!

19
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,799
Yeah, so what do you 
think would look better?

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,679
Um.

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,359
Tribal? Arabic?

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,200
Cliff, you're wasted.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,079
You are gonna be paying 
penance with your life

24
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,280
if you get a tattoo. Mom 
and Dad are going to kill you.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
There's that trusty
Catholic guilt-tripping again.

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,200
Relax. Jocelyn's the 
only one getting one.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
Who's Jocelyn?

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
- A girl.
- No shit.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Don't get her name tattooed...

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,280
or mine... or yours, 
for that matter.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Joce is a huge 
fan, by the way.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,519
Say 'hi', babe.

33
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,239
[gasps] 
Oh my god...

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,319
Zanna, you kicked ass 
in Thailand, queen.

35
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,159
Thanks.

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,480
I've got a new 'Run
Diary' dropping tonight.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh, bet. 
I'll be watching.

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,719
[laughs]

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,640
Do you use 
me to get girls?

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,319
- Of course.
- Hey! Shut up!

41
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
Ok.

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,079
Um.

43
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,439
So, is that why 
you called me?

44
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,959
No.

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,519
So, just give 
me one sec.

46
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,439
Ok, I'll be right 
back, babe.

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,640
Stay strong.

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,319
Those stars are so unique.

49
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,959
Could you wire 
me some cash?

50
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,359
Shit's a little 
expensive out here.

51
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,159
You mean drugs 
are expensive.

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,599
Cliff, you're supposed 
to be studying.

53
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,159
Well, I'm nailing 
my grades anyway.

54
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,480
Come on, Zan.
Life's to be lived, you know?

55
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,560
We're all going 
to die someday.

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
- Would you rather--
- Save it.

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,560
Ok, so... the cash?

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
[sighs]

59
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,840
I mean... I promise...
I'll never ask again.

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
It's just so I can 
get through this date.

61
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,919
Please.
