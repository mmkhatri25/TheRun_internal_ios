1
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,759
[phone rings]

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,320
Eurgh... Brian.

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,559
I've been trying you
for the past hour, Zanna.

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,199
You know it's 
past my bedtime.

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,960
Yeah, sorry, the
signal isn't great out here.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
Weren't you supposed to
fly home directly from Thailand?

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,679
Well, I took 
the scenic route.

8
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,879
You know you have 
a scheduled meeting

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,160
with a competition 
winner, right?

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,799
One of those
underprivileged, terminally ill,

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,119
whatever kids. You know 
what I'm talking about.

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,759
Shit, sorry. 
I forgot.

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,640
Well, I can't do anything 
in person, can I?

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,159
Hm.

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,600
Yeah, yeah. 
I know you.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
That's why I 
scheduled a video call.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,479
The kid's on the
other line, please take it.

18
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,079
Brian, I'm on a run!

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
[sighs]

20
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,719
Zanna.

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,079
I need you to 
take this call.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,280
We don't want the 
charity or the parents...

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,880
... complaining to the press.
