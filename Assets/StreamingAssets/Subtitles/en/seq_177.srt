My brave boy.

What the fuck 
is going on?!

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
From what I can see, 
which is not a lot,

00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
it's really beautiful!

17
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,840
But let me tell you...

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
These mountain 
roads are crazy.

<i>you are on a middle plane.</i>

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>A place which offers salvation </i>

Yes!

Yeah, come this way!

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,879
I ran...

51
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
... and I shouldn't have run.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,319
You're a good person, Zanna.

53
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,919
You've done enough 
to be saved.

Am I?

The kid's on the other line.
Please take it.

Brian, I'm on a run!

Help!

58

Get out of there, 
you little prick!

Please! Help me!

He's too fast. 
He'll get us.

61
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,159
No. Come on. 
We can outrun him!

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,960
Leave me, Zanna! Please.

Come on...

My beautiful baby brother.

You were right.

Wake up!

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
I am going to give you one
last motivational speech

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,319
So, you listen to me.

You keep fighting, ok?

[tearful]
Keep fighting!

80
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,160
Because you need more time 
to spread your amazing energy.

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
So just keep, keep going.

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,519
Keep fighting... for me.

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,160
Please... because I love you.
