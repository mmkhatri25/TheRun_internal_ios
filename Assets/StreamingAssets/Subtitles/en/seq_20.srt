A podcast.

00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,320
Play this week's episode 
of the Chase Peters show.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,320
<i>I'm Chase Peters and you're </i>
<i>listening to 'Motivate The State'.</i>

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,480
<i>Today's guest is the lady </i>
<i>who made you tougher.</i>

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,039
<i>Zanna Hendricks.</i>

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,640
<i>Thank you for </i>
<i>having me, Chase.</i>

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,879
<i>Pleasure's all mine. Let's get </i>
<i>right into your new ebook:</i>

8
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,440
<i>'Nice Is A Vice'.</i>

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,960
<i>Now, what's wrong </i>
<i>with being nice?</i>

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
<i>On the face </i>
<i>of it, nothing.</i>

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
<i>But I mean, every </i>
<i>idealist preaches</i>

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
<i>having empathy and </i>
<i>kindness for others.</i>

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>- Well, of course we do.
- But nice girls and guys and theys,</i>

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,479
<i>they finish last.</i>

15
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,920
<i>... and I'm not saying </i>
<i>niceness isn't a virtue.</i>

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
<i>but I'm saying that </i>
<i>you'll get trodden on...</i>

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,719
<i>... by those who are </i>
<i>ascending to the top.</i>

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,840
<i>But what would the
world be without nice people?</i>

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,479
<i>A terrible place.</i>

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>But I'm just saying
leave it up to others.</i>

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,079
<i>If you have real goals,</i>

22
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,479
<i>I think niceness </i>
<i>just hinders you.</i>

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
[engine revs]

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,719
[engine revs aggressively]

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Shit.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
What is your 
fucking problem?

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Hello.

28
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,519
Hi...

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
