1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,679
Ok.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's get out of here.

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,320
[gasping]

4
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,880
<i>One new video message </i>
<i>from 'Clifford Hendricks'.</i>

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,960
Matteo, slow down a sec.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,159
- Zan!
- Hey Zan!

7
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,920
Yo, so we are 
riding home.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,200
Well, I didn't get the 
tattoo in the end but

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
we got these instead.

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,799
[laughs]

11
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,439
So, listen. I just
want to say - I love you.

12
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,719
Even though, like, I
never get to see you anymore

13
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,040
because, like, you're
busy breaking the internet.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,439
But you deserve 
that success, right?

15
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,120
Stay on the grind, sis.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,439
Oh and thank you so 
much for the money.

17
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,599
As you can 
see, we are

18
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,560
riding home in style 
thanks to you.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,719
- Woo! 
- Woo!

20
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,480
Who's the party boy?

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,079
My brother, Cliff.

22
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,599
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

23
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,120
You know the type.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,079
He'll go far.

25
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,560
... and you aren't positive?

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
No, I am when I 
need to be.

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,200
Your earphones stayed in?

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,879
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

30
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm the brand's ambassador.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,719
I get five figures 
every time I say

32
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,519
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Nice.

34
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,840
Nonna!

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,240
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

36
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,039
You trying to 
get us killed?!

37
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,319
Sorry.
