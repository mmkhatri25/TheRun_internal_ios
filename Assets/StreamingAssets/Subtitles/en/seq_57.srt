1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,239
Wow.

2
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,239
This place is super eerie.

3
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,800
I wonder how many 
soldiers it held here?

4
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,120
How many lived here?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,000
How many died here?

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,119
[laughs]

7
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,600
Ok, seriously?

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,399
This place is giving 
New York loft vibes.

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,719
What's on that cloth?

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,280
[phone rings]

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Oh, for fuck's sake, Brian.

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I've been trying you
for the past hour, Zanna.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,040
You know it's 
past my bedtime.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,799
Yeah, sorry, the
signal isn't great out here.

15
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,879
Weren't you supposed to
fly home directly from Thailand?

16
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,519
Well, I took 
the scenic route.

17
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,719
You know you have 
a scheduled meeting

18
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,000
with a competition 
winner, right?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,640
One of those
underprivileged, terminally ill,

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,959
whatever kids. You know 
what I'm talking about.

21
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,599
Shit, sorry. 
I forgot.

22
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,480
Well, I can't do anything 
in person, can I?

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,000
Hm.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,439
Yeah, yeah. 
I know you.

25
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,120
That's why I 
scheduled a video call.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,319
The kid's on the
other line, please take it.

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,920
Brian, I'm on a run!

28
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,079
[sighs]

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Zanna.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
I need you to 
take this call.

31
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,120
We don't want the 
charity or the parents...

32
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,719
... complaining to the press.
