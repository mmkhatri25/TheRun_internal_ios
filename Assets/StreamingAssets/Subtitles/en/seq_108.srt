1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,120
His nonna better be 
Mother fucking Teresa.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:05,200
Matteo, wait!

3
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,119
[gasping]

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,679
<i>One new video message </i>
<i>from 'Clifford Hendricks'.</i>

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,759
Matteo, slow down a sec.

6
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,960
- Zan!
- Hey Zan!

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,719
Yo, so we are 
riding home.

8
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, I didn't get the 
tattoo in the end but

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we got these instead.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
[laughs]

11
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,239
So, listen. I just
want to say - I love you.

12
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,519
Even though, like, I
never get to see you anymore

13
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,840
because, like, you're
busy breaking the internet.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,239
But you deserve 
that success, right?

15
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,920
Stay on the grind, sis.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,239
Oh and thank you so 
much for the money.

17
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,400
As you can 
see, we are

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,359
riding home in style 
thanks to you.

19
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,519
- Woo! 
- Woo!

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,280
Who's the party boy?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,879
My brother, Cliff.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
You know the type.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,879
He'll go far.

25
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,359
... and you aren't positive?

26
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,359
No, I am when I 
need to be.

27
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,359
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

28
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,000
Your earphones stayed in?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,680
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,719
I'm the brand's ambassador.

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,519
I get five figures 
every time I say

32
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,319
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

33
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,719
Nice.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,640
Nonna!

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,039
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

36
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,840
You trying to 
get us killed?!

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Sorry.
