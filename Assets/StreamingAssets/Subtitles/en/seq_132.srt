1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:07,960
Come on.

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's lock him in.

3
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,599
The toll woman usually 
stands outside this hut.

4
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,400
Yeah, well, not today.

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
Wait, stop!

6
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,319
Can you hear that?

7
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
No.

8
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,079
[distant church bell]

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
There is life in Libitina.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Here.

11
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on.

12
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
[distant church bell]

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,599
[distant church bell]

14
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
[church bell ringing]

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,759
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

16
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,159
We need to warn them.

17
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,560
Matteo, wait.

18
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,039
I want to tell 
you something.

19
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,120
I don't remember how 
we met or what we did.

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,919
I just...

21
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,919
... remember waking 
up with you.

22
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,199
... and

23
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,240
I'm really glad we did.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Same.

25
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,919
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,520
<i>and women</i>

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,240
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

29
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,759
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,599
[doors opening]

31
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,240
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

32
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,639
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

33
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,319
<i>The final purification</i>

34
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,319
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,599
Matteo...

36
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Nonna?

37
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,560
Matteo, wait!
