1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,439
Ok.

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,519
All right, let's come
to some sort of arrangement.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,839
A trade.

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,960
Trade?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,080
What do you have?

7
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,679
This.

8
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,079
You like it?

9
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,479
This promises great fortune.

10
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,679
- Where did you get--
- Ah!

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,039
Doesn't matter 
where I got it.

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
Do we have a deal?

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,719
Yes.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,600
Yes, we have a deal.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,439
Least surprising plot twist ever.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,840
You make bad deal.
