1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,080
Yeah, you're right.

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,360
We don't know 
anything, do we?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,359
I can't even be sure
that you're not one of them.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,279
- What?
- How can I trust you Matteo?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
I helped you kill 
one of them!

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,760
[panting]

7
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,560
Come on.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm so sorry. It's my fault. 
I shouldn't have stopped.

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
It's fine.

10
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,719
He would've stabbed 
us both. He was fast.

11
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,920
Come on.

12
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,519
Come on!

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
[heavy panting]

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,439
All right. I can't keep 
up the tough guy act.

15
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,439
Please, can we rest?

16
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,239
Ok...

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Ok... but just 
for a minute.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
[panting]

19
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,640
You've always 
been a strong Catholic?

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
Not always.

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,719
I'm trying to improve.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,439
I'm a coward.

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,159
Come on. 
You're not a coward.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,239
You were a soldier. You wear
those stupid boots all the time.

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,400
I was discharged 
with dishonor.

26
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,719
Why?

27
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,599
Desertion.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
It haunts me every day.

29
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,319
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,199
I really need something 
for this pain.

31
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,120
Try these...

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
These are herbs 
from the mountain.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,319
They only grow here.

34
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,120
Well, are they any good?

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Never tried them.

36
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,639
Now's as good 
a time as any.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,879
We've stayed too long.

38
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,479
Time to go. Come on.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,879
Watch it. Watch it!

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,319
Come on.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,560
[phone pings]

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,759
Video message 
from Clifford Hendricks.

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,479
Hold on, slow down.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,520
Zanna...

45
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
Zanna, oh my God...

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,840
Cliff's been in an accident.

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,759
We were attacked 
and he defended me,

48
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,759
but they beat 
him up really bad.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,000
He didn't have any 
money for a taxi,

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,120
so, we were walking home
and these guys just like...

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,919
... they just, like, 
jumped us.

52
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,879
They're taking him 
to the hospital.

53
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
They're gonna do 
an emergency operation.

54
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,479
These guys that attacked 
us, they were like sickos.

55
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,280
They wore like these, 
I don't know...

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,080
... these skull masks.

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,360
Oh fuck!

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,159
What?

59
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,879
- What is it? What? 
- Fuck! Come on!

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,919
Shit.

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,639
Go. Go!

62
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,120
Quickly. 
Down here.

63
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,839
Go, go, go.

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Argh!

65
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,879
I need more 
of those herbs.

66
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,879
Shit...

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Here.

68
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,480
Finish them.

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Swallow it!

70
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,519
Ok, good. 
Let's go!

71
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,399
Zanna...

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Stay here.
