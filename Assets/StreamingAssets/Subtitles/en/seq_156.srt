[choking]

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,760
[stab in back]

3
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,320
[gasping for air]

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Matteo!

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Come on! Come on,
we must be so close now.

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
- Come on.
- I've lost too much blood.

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,239
I...

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
No, come on. You can
do this, you can do this!

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,840
Argh...

10
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,159
Ok.

11
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,959
I'm gonna find help.

12
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,959
Shit...

13
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh, come on.

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,199
Come on...

15
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,199
Shit!

16
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,719
[gasps]

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,039
Get away from him.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,240
[muffled dialogue]

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,080
[muffled dialogue]

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
What are you saying? 
I can't hear...

21
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,360
[distant church bell]

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,159
Matteo? Matteo...

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,479
I feel a lot better.

24
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Weird.

25
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,000
On your feet.

26
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
The bells...

27
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Yes.

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
There is life in Libitina.

29
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,639
Let's go!

30
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,560
[distant church bell]

31
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
[distant church bell]

32
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,960
[church bell]

33
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,800
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

34
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,039
We need to warn them.

35
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,240
Matteo, wait.

36
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
I want to tell 
you something.

37
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,159
I don't remember how 
we met or what we did.

38
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,960
I just...

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
... remember waking 
up with you.

40
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,159
... and

41
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,199
I'm really glad we did.

42
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Same.

43
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,879
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

44
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,480
<i>and women</i>

45
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,519
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,199
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

48
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,560
[doors opening]

49
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,199
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,600
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

51
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,279
<i>The final purification</i>

52
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,279
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
Matteo...

54
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,759
Nonna?

55
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,519
Matteo, wait!
