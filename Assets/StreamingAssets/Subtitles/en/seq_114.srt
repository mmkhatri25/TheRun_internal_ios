[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
You always wanted 
to be a vlogger?

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,039
Not exactly.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,960
I was a really 
good youth runner,

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,280
but I wasn't the best.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,480
What?

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,039
... and you need 
to be the best?

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,640
Yeah, of course.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,799
So, I pivoted to
online health and fitness.

10
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,520
Now I'm just a few million followers
away from being the best.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Must take a lot of discipline 
to film your every move.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,799
Yeah, good Catholic discipline.

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,119
You're Catholic too?

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,960
Not so much now, but 
the discipline was instilled

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,520
- in me at a young age.
- By who?

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,280
Sorry, you probably
told me all this last night,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,759
but I don't remember a thing.

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,479
Didn't realize I 
got that wasted.

19
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,079
Yeah, me either.

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,879
Although, I have an excuse.

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,959
Jet lag and a six and a
half hour drive to get here.

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,599
So, you're a 
role model, huh?

23
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,280
[laughs]

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,519
I guess.

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,799
It feels weird 
saying that out loud.

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,599
But I've never really understood 
why somebody would follow

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,719
somebody who can do
something that they can't.

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,319
But it is what it is, and if I 
don't do it, somebody else will.

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,519
Well, keep going.

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,879
Someday you might be able
to retire out here in Libitina.

31
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,359
[laughs]
Yeah.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
So, what about you?

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,480
You're not into social media?

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Nah, signal's shit out here.
There's no point.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,000
Why don't you just leave?

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,079
You're too young to 
be here anyway.

37
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,159
I chose to be here.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,079
Yeah, but why?

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
Obligation to your grandparents?

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I wanted 
to better myself.

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
Work on that Catholic discipline.

42
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,159
Jesus, your nonna 
must have had

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,280
ankles of steel to 
run this every day.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
So listen, this is 
slightly awkward but

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,000
are you so Catholic that
you didn't use a condom last night?

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,400
Uh...

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
I don't know.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Jesus, why can't 
we remember?

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,120
Who lives there?

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Just a crazy old guy.

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
No red mark.

52
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,000
- Nonna might be in there.
- Easy, tiger.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
We just passed 
two corpses in a car.

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Yeah, they were 
killed hours ago.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
What?

56
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,439
When you left my place
this morning, you left by road.

57
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,719
You would have passed
that car on your way home.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,800
I go a different way.

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Really?

60
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
Because there's only 
one road on the map.

61
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,759
Yeah, I go off-road.

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
I helped you kill 
one of them, Zanna.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Shit.

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,759
God, I don't know 
what to believe anymore.

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,479
[gunshot]

66
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,599
Get down!

67
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,520
Shit!

68
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,919
Oh god...

69
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,560
[gunshot]

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,479
Winchester 243.

71
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,360
The rifle.

72
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,159
I can hear it.

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,439
It holds five rounds.

74
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,360
You've got a few 
seconds between shots.

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,199
[gunshot]

76
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,960
Go!

77
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,280
[gun reload]

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,599
Shit.

79
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,759
[gunshot]

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,319
Oh, whoa, whoa! 
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,959
I'm just a runner.

82
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,519
<i>Who did I shoot?</i>

83
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,399
<i>Tell me!</i>

84
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't understand...

85
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,959
Uh...

86
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,160
American.

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
My friend... he's hurt.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,120
He needs medicine.

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Do you have 
any medicine?

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Ok...

91
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,079
[pained grunting]

92
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,240
Ah! <i>Che cazzo</i>!

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,839
Calm down.

94
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,600
<i>You're wasting 12 year old single malt</i>

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,519
<i>on a traitor and a coward.</i>

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
What did he say?

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,319
Just insults.

98
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,879
I told you he's crazy.

99
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:45,399
<i>You're lucky my bullet </i>
<i>skimmed past you.</i>

100
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,079
[pained chuckle]

101
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,800
Tell him-- listen.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,079
Next, I'll pull that 
bolt out of you--

103
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,879
No.

104
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,399
<i>It's pierced my lung.</i>

105
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,480
<i>I'll suffocate on my own </i>
<i>blood if you pull it out.</i>

106
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,279
<i>What happened to you?</i>

107
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,360
<i>I was leaving for a morning hunt...</i>

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,160
He says an attacker shot him 
and left him to die like an animal.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Which one was it?

110
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,240
<i>What colour was their mask?</i>

111
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>It was...</i>

112
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,759
<i>... white like bone.</i>

113
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,800
Do you have a landline? 
A telephone that

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,720
we can call for help?

115
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,800
<i>They cut the phone line.</i>

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
<i>The hunter became </i>
<i>the hunted.</i>

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,759
<i>I'm going to </i>
<i>die a cliche...</i>

118
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,319
<i>... but I've got one bullet </i>
<i>left for that bastard.</i>

119
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,199
<b>One bullet is enough.</b>

120
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,680
<i>You are from Libitina.</i>

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,680
<i>Everyone here knows </i>
<i>how to beat death.</i>

122
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:53,240
<i>Trust someone who served </i>
<i>this country for 40 years.</i>

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,319
<i>The reaper comes </i>
<i>for us all.</i>

124
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,759
<i>No matter how </i>
<i>fast or far...</i>

125
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,120
<i>... you run.</i>

126
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,480
Ok, listen.
Tell him...

127
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,199
When we get back to Libitina, 
we're going to send help. Ok?

128
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,319
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait. You can't leave him.

129
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,480
What are you talking about?
He doesn't want our help.

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
But it's wrong.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,160
It's wrong?!

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,480
He's got a gun.

133
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,800
Better in here 
than out there.

134
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
He's got a gun 
with one bullet.

135
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,399
Better than none.
