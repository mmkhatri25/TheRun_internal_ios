00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,640
There's only one way to make 
sure he doesn't follow us again.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,080
You've got the knife...

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
No.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
I can't do it.

5
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,280
Watch that wire!

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,719
Got it.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,359
Hey, stop!

8
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,200
Zanna!

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop!

10
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,479
Can you hear that?

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,079
No...

12
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,640
[distant church bell]

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,040
There is life in Libitina.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Here.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,879
[distant church bell]

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120
[distant church bell]

17
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,000
[church bell]

18
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,120
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,719
We need to warn them.

20
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,719
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,359
<i>and women</i>

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,040
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

24
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,640
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

25
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,400
[doors opening]

26
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,039
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,439
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,120
<i>The final purification</i>

29
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

30
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,400
Matteo...

31
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,599
Nonna?

32
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,360
Matteo, wait!
