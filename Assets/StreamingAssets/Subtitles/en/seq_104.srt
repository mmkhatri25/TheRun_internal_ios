Nonna!

00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,239
Nonna!

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,920
<i>That's how we grow.</i>

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,320
<i>Well, I'd rather grow </i>
<i>through success alone.</i>

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,560
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,119
<i>What made you </i>
<i>like this, Zanna?</i>

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,520
<i>A heartbreak?</i>

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,359
<i>Better to have loved </i>
<i>and lost than never--</i>

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,560
<i>Oh, come on, Chase. </i>
<i>Don't patronize me.</i>

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,960
<i>What then?</i>

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,520
<i>What was the moment </i>

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,479
<i>your very nature </i>
<i>as a person?</i>

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,880

Fuck!

23
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,359
Jesus Christ!

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,799
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

25
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,439
Yeah, well, I didn't.

27
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,520
Put the fucking knife away.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Right...

Matteo, slow down a sec.

31
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
- Zan!
- Hey Zan!

32
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,960
Yo, so we are 
riding home.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
Well, I didn't get the 
tattoo in the end but

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
we got these instead.

35
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,840
[laughs]

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,479
So, listen. I just
want to say - I love you.

37
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,759
Even though, like, I
never get to see you anymore

38
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,080
because, like, you're
busy breaking the internet.

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,479
But you deserve 
that success, right?

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
Stay on the grind, sis.

41
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,479
Oh and thank you so 
much for the money.

42
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,639
As you can 
see, we are

43
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,599
riding home in style 
thanks to you.

44
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,759
- Woo! 
- Woo!

45
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,520
Who's the party boy?

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
My brother, Cliff.

47
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,639
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,159
You know the type.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
He'll go far.

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,599
... and you aren't positive?

51
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
No, I am when I 
need to be.

52
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,599
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

53
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,240
Your earphones stayed in?

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,919
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

55
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm the brand's ambassador.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,759
I get five figures 
every time I say

57
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,560
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Nice.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,879
Nonna!

60
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,280
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,080
You trying to 
get us killed?!

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Sorry.
