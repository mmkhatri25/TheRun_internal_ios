1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,000
It's Matteo. I came for you!

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,720
Our souls must suffer

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,640
and do good works

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
that break us of attachments

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,519
of sin and self.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,719
Wake up!

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,840
This...

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,799
... is the word of God.

9
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,880
What's happening?

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,520
I found you...

11
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,719
... hanging in the barn.

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
In this moment,

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,640
you are on a middle plane.

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,640
Purgatory?

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,640
A place which offers salvation 
and purification...

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,359
... in the form of a test.

17
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,919
It is a test you have passed.

18
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,680
Thanks to your actions here,

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,159
you have purged your venial sin of

20
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,439
Cowardice.

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
You shall now...

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,319
... ascend.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,960
... and Zanna?

24
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,639
She too has been tested.

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
To purge her soul

26
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,639
of her venial sin...

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
Selfishness.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
... and?

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Has she done enough to be saved?

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,759
No, my treasure...

31
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,039
She failed the ultimate test.

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,159
No, no, no...

33
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,159
She's a good person.
