00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

2
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
<i>and women</i>

3
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,039
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

4
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

5
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,280
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

6
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,639
Even the least pains in purgatory

7
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,039
are greater than what ever pain 
is imaginable in the world.

8
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,720
The final purification

9
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
of the elect after death.
