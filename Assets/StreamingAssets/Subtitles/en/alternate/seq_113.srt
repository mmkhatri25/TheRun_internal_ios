1
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,199
Who did I shoot?

2
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,079
Tell me!

3
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,279
You're wasting 12 year old single malt

4
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,199
on a traitor and a coward.

5
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,079
You're lucky my bullet 
skimmed past you.

6
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,079
It's pierced my lung.

7
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,160
I'll suffocate on my own 
blood if you pull it out.

8
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,959
What happened to you?

9
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,040
I was leaving for a morning hunt...

10
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,920
What colour was their mask?

11
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,680
It was...

12
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,439
... white like bone.

13
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,480
They cut the phone line.

14
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,319
The hunter became the hunted.

15
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,439
I'm going to die a cliche...

16
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,000
... but I've got one bullet 
left for that bastard.

17
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,360
You are from Libitina.

18
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Everyone here knows 
how to beat death.

19
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,920
Trust someone who served 
this country for 40 years.

20
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,000
The reaper comes for us all.

21
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,439
No matter how fast or far...

22
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,800
... you run.
