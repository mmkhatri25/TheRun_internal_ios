1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,879
It's Matteo. I came for you!

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,439
Our souls must suffer

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,880
and do good works

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,679
that break us of attachments

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,000
of sin and self.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,320
Wake up!

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
This...

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,719
... is the word of God.

9
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,359
Nonna, speak to me.

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,920
What's happening?

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,439
I found you...

12
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,599
... hanging in the barn.

13
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,239
In this moment,

14
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,400
you are on a middle plane.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,480
A place which offers salvation 
and purification...

16
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,480
... in the form of a test.

17
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,680
Purgatory?

18
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,640
It is a test you have passed.

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
Thanks to your actions here,

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,039
you have purged your venial sin of

21
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,159
Cowardice.

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
You shall now...

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,039
... ascend.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
... and Zanna?

25
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,080
She too has been tested.

26
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
To purge her soul

27
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,039
of her venial sin...

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,680
Selfishness.
