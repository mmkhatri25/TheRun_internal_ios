1
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Who did I shoot?

2
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Tell me!

3
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,199
You're wasting 12 year old single malt

4
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,120
on a traitor and a coward.

5
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,000
You're lucky my bullet 
skimmed past you.

6
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,000
It's pierced my lung.

7
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,079
I'll suffocate on my own 
blood if you pull it out.

8
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,879
What happened to you?

9
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,959
I was leaving for a morning hunt...

10
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,839
What colour was their mask?

11
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
It was...

12
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,360
... white like bone.

13
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,399
They cut the phone line.

14
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,240
The hunter became the hunted.

15
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm going to die a cliche...

16
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,920
... but I've got one bullet 
left for that bastard.

17
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,279
You are from Libitina.

18
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,279
Everyone here knows 
how to beat death.

19
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,839
Trust someone who served 
this country for 40 years.

20
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,920
The reaper comes for us all.

21
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,360
No matter how fast or far...

22
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,720
... you run.
