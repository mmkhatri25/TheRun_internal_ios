1
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,519
Who did I shoot?

2
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,399
Tell me!

3
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,600
You're wasting 12 year old single malt

4
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,519
on a traitor and a coward.

5
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:45,399
You're lucky my bullet 
skimmed past you.

6
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,399
It's pierced my lung.

7
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,480
I'll suffocate on my own 
blood if you pull it out.

8
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,279
What happened to you?

9
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,360
I was leaving for a morning hunt...

10
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,240
What colour was their mask?

11
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,000
It was...

12
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,759
... white like bone.

13
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,800
They cut the phone line.

14
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
The hunter became the hunted.

15
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,759
I'm going to die a cliche...

16
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,319
... but I've got one bullet 
left for that bastard.

17
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,680
You are from Libitina.

18
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Everyone here knows 
how to beat death.

19
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:53,240
Trust someone who served 
this country for 40 years.

20
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,319
The reaper comes for us all.

21
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,759
No matter how fast or far...

22
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,120
... you run.
