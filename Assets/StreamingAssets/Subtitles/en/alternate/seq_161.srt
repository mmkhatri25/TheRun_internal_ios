00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

2
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,400
<i>and women</i>

3
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,439
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

4
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,079
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,680
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

6
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Even the least pains in purgatory

7
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,479
are greater than what ever pain 
is imaginable in the world.

8
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,159
The final purification

9
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,159
of the elect after death.
