1
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,599
Who did I shoot?

2
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,479
Tell me!

3
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,680
You're wasting 12 year old single malt

4
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,600
on a traitor and a coward.

5
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,480
You're lucky my bullet 
skimmed past you.

6
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,480
It's pierced my lung.

7
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,560
I'll suffocate on my own 
blood if you pull it out.

8
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
What happened to you?

9
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,439
I was leaving for a morning hunt...

10
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,319
What colour was their mask?

11
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,079
It was...

12
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,839
... white like bone.

13
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,879
They cut the phone line.

14
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,720
The hunter became the hunted.

15
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,839
I'm going to die a cliche...

16
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,399
... but I've got one bullet 
left for that bastard.

17
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,759
You are from Libitina.

18
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,759
Everyone here knows 
how to beat death.

19
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,319
Trust someone who served 
this country for 40 years.

20
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,399
The reaper comes for us all.

21
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,839
No matter how fast or far...

22
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,199
... you run.
