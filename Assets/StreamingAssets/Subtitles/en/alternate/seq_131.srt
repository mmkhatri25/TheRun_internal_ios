00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

2
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,759
<i>and women</i>

3
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,800
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

4
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,439
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

5
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,039
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

6
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Even the least pains in purgatory

7
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,800
are greater than what ever pain 
is imaginable in the world.

8
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,480
The final purification

9
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
of the elect after death.
