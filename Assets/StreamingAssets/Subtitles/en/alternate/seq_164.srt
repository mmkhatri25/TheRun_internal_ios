00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

2
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,519
<i>and women</i>

3
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,560
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

4
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,240
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

5
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,759
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

6
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Even the least pains in purgatory

7
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,639
are greater than what ever pain 
is imaginable in the world.

8
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,319
The final purification

9
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,319
of the elect after death.
