00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,719
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

2
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,359
<i>and women</i>

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,400
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,040
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

5
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,640
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

6
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,039
Even the least pains in purgatory

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,439
are greater than what ever pain 
is imaginable in the world.

8
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
The final purification

9
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
of the elect after death.
