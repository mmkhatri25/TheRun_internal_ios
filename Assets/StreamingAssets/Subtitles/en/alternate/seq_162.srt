00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

2
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,560
<i>and women</i>

3
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,599
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

4
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,280
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

5
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,800
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

6
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Even the least pains in purgatory

7
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,680
are greater than what ever pain 
is imaginable in the world.

8
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,360
The final purification

9
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
of the elect after death.
