00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,280
Guys, I've got places
to be and very little time.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,480
Sorry.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,280
[phone rings]

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,559
Oh, shit.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,480
[groans]

6
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,320
Hey.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,199
I've been trying you
for the past hour, Zanna.

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,519
You know it's 
past my bedtime.

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah, well, signal's 
shit out here.

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,399
What?!

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,479
Weren't you supposed to
fly home directly from Thailand?

12
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,000
I took the scenic route.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
You know you have 
a scheduled meeting

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,479
with a competition 
winner, right?

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,119
One of those
underprivileged, terminally ill,

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,439
whatever kids. You know 
what I'm talking about.

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, shit.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sorry.
I totally forgot.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,560
- Yeah.
- Well, I can't do anything in person.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,600
So...

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,119
Hm.

22
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,560
Yeah, yeah. 
I know you.

23
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,240
That's why I 
scheduled a video call.

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,439
The kid's on the
other line, please take it.

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,320
Ah, Brian!

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,359
I'm begging you 
to take this call.

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,159
We don't want the charity or the
parents complaining to the press.
