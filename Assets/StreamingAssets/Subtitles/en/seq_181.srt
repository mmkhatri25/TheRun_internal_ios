<i>Wake up!</i>

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
<i>This...</i>

My brave boy.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,560
What the fuck 
is going on?!

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,960
<i>So guys, I've finally </i>
<i>made it to Libitina.</i>

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
From what I can see, 
which is not a lot,

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
it's really beautiful!

17
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,840
But let me tell you...

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
These mountain 
roads are crazy.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,200
There's no streelights, nothing--

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,439
<i>I found you...</i>

00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,599
<i>... hanging in the barn.</i>

00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>In this moment,</i>

27
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,400
<i>you are on a middle plane.</i>

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>A place which offers salvation </i>

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,480
<i>... in the form of a test.</i>

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,959
Bullshit!

31
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,680
<i>Purgatory?</i>

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes!

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>It is a test you </i>

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Yeah, come this way!

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
<i>Thanks to your actions here,</i>

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,039
<i>you have purged </i>

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,159
<i>Cowardice.</i>

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
<i>You shall now...</i>

<i>Selfishness.</i>

48
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,360

[crowd cheering]

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,879
I ran...

51
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
... and I shouldn't have run.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,319
You're a good person, Zanna.

53
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,919
You've done enough 
to be saved.

54
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,639
Am I?

55
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,719
The kid's on the other line.
Please take it.

56
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,120
Argh, Brian!

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
I am begging you 
to take this call.

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
Help!

59
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,439
Get out of there, 
you little prick!

Please! Help me!

61
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,000
He's too fast. 
He'll get us.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,719
No. Come on. 
We can outrun him!

63
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,520
Leave me, Zanna! Please.

Come on...

My beautiful baby brother.

69
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,360
You were right.

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,959
Life is to be lived.

Wake up!

77
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,279
I am going to give you one
last motivational speech

78
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,800
So, you listen to me.

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,680
You keep fighting, ok?

80

[tearful]
Keep fighting!

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,639
Because you need more time 
to spread your amazing energy.

82
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,639
So just keep, keep going.

83
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,000
Keep fighting... for me.

00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,639
Please... because I love you.

You're gonna be okay!
