Play this week's episode 
of the Chase Peters show.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,759
<b>Sure.</b>

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,960
<i>I'm Chase Peters and you're </i>
<i>listening to 'Motivate The State'.</i>

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,119
<i>Today's guest is the lady </i>
<i>who made you tougher.</i>

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,880
<i>Zanna Hendricks.</i>

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,760
<i>Thank you for </i>
<i>having me, Chase.</i>

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,879
<i>Pleasure's all mine. Let's get </i>
<i>right into your new ebook:</i>

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>'Nice Is A Vice'.</i>

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,199
<i>Now, what's wrong </i>
<i>with being nice?</i>

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,039
<i>On the face </i>
<i>of it, nothing.</i>

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,719
<i>But I mean, every </i>
<i>idealist preaches</i>

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,240
<i>having empathy and </i>
<i>kindness for others.</i>

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>- Well, of course we do.
- But nice girls and guys and theys,</i>

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,679
<i>they finish last.</i>

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,359
<i>... and I'm not saying </i>
<i>niceness isn't a virtue.</i>

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,000
<i>but I'm saying that </i>
<i>you'll get trodden on...</i>

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>... by those who are </i>
<i>ascending to the top.</i>

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
<i>But what would the
world be without nice people?</i>

20
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,840
<i>A terrible place.</i>

21
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,759
<i>But I'm just saying
leave it up to others.</i>

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,560
<i>If you have real goals,</i>

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,960
<i>I think niceness </i>
<i>just hinders you.</i>

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Wow.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,239
Hey guys, check out this fort.

26
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,519
It is incredible.

27
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,159
It looks like
something from a bygone era.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,879
So...

29
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,879
... my question to you is...

30
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,480
... should I go in 
and check it out?

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,879
What do you think?
