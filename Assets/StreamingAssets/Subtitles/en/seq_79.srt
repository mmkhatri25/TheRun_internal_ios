[snorts]

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,200
Well, I wasn't gonna
wear your grimey shit, was I?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,039
Did you lock the door?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Uh...

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,199
Where's your key?!

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,440
There's no crime around here.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,000
What? So, how do 
you lock the doors?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,399
- I don't.
- What?

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,960
Wanna tell me 
what's going on?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,359
Yeah, I borrowed some 
of your wife's clothes.

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,719
[chuckles] 
My wife?

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,520
Yeah, I didn't think 
she'd mind.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Don't worry, your 
secret's safe with me.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
No, those are 
my nonna's clothes.

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,399
I told you about 
her this morning.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,200
Anyway, why would 
you need them?

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Because mine made me
look like a big pink target.

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,640
Where is your nonna?

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,039
She went for a run.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
Matteo, I am running 
from three...

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,520
... now two... killers.

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,039
Killers?!
[chuckles]

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
Your nonna is 
in serious danger.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
Nothing bad ever 
happens out here.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,959
Look, I don't know
what's going on either.

26
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,359
You want me to run into
the woods and leave you here alone.

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,959
What the fuck would I
steal from a farm, you idiot?!

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
Matteo!

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,799
Matteo, you have 
to believe me.

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,959
Show me proof!

31
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,640
I don't have any proof!
I've been running for my life!

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,159
Please leave, Zanna.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
What?

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,480
My axe?

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,959
Matteo!

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,560
Listen to me.

37
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,239
Shit...

38
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,439
Inside.

39
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,200
Get inside!

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Hey!

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,920
Yeah, come this way!

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Shit!

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
