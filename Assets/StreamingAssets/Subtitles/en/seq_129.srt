1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,879
I am making sure he 
never follows us again.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,839
Come on.

3
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,879
The toll woman usually 
stands outside this hut.

4
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,159
- Yeah, well, not today.
- [phone pings]

5
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,879
Unopened video message 
from Clifford Hendricks.

6
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,760
Zanna... 
Zanna, oh my God...

7
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,159
Cliff's been in an accident.

8
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,920
We were attacked 
and he defended me,

9
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,719
but they beat 
him up really bad.

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,359
He didn't have any 
money for a taxi,

11
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,599
so, we were walking home
and these guys just like...

12
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,400
... they just like, 
jumped us.

13
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,079
They're taking him 
to the hospital.

14
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,079
They're gonna do 
an emergency operation.

15
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,680
These guys that attacked 
us, they were like sickos.

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,439
They wore like these, 
I don't know...

17
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,239
... these skull masks.

18
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,959
Oh my god.

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,959
Fuck.

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,159
Fuck!

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,479
Zanna...

22
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,479
No.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
My brother.

24
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,680
My baby brother...

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Shit...

26
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,639
This is all my fault.

27
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,439
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
I was trying to 
teach him a lesson.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
... and he will learn.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,199
We're nearly in Libitina.

31
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,599
You can go to him.

32
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,800
[heavy breath]

33
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,360
What if it's too late?

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,759
Zanna! Can you hear that?

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,599
[distant church bell]

36
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,199
There is life in Libitina.

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Here.

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Come on. It's okay.

39
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go.

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,080
[distant church bell]

41
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,520
[distant church bell]

42
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
[church bell ringing]

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,759
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

44
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,360
We need to warn them.

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

46
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
<i>and women</i>

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,039
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

48
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

49
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,280
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
[doors opening]

51
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,639
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

52
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,039
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,720
<i>The final purification</i>

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

55
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Matteo...

56
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,199
Nonna?

57
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,959
Matteo, wait!
