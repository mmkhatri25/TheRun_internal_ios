13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,679

What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

28
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah, well, I didn't.

- Hey Zanna!

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,039
So we are 
walking home.

I didn't get the tattoo in 
the end, but guess what?

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,039
I got this instead...

So listen, I 
just wanna say -

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
I love you.

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,039
Even though I never get 
to see you anymore because

43
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,479
you're, I don't know, 
busy breaking the internet.

44
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,280
But...

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
... you deserve that success.

46
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,800
- Tell her.
- You do, you really do.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Stay on the grind, sis!

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
Oh, and no hard feelings 
about the money.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,479
Tough love, like, I get it.

Who's the party boy?

My brother, Cliff.

54
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,080
You know the type.

56
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,039
He'll go far.

57
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,520
... and you aren't positive?

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
No, I am when I 
need to be.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,159
Your earphones stayed in?

61
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,840
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,879
I'm the brand's ambassador.

63
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,680
I get five figures 
every time I say

64
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,479
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

65
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,879
Nice.

Nonna!

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,199
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

68
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,000
You trying to 
get us killed?!

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Sorry.
