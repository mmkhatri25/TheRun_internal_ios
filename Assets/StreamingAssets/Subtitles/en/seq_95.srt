1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All right.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,719
Let's check it out.

3
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,039
Zanna.

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
They've marked the
homes outside of Libitina.

5
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,759
Three guesses what 
the red X's mean.

6
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,039
There's no mark 
on our farm.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,719
Let's check the trunk.

8
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,039
Anything?

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
I think you 
should see this.

10
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
- What's all this?
- Hunting gear.

11
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,799
... and I know these 
are firearms boxes.

12
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,200
Empty firearms boxes.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,680
Let's go.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,319
[shuts trunk]

15
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,879
Matteo! 
Let's take the car.

16
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,439
You can only follow 
the trail by foot.

17
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,040
The key's not in the ignition.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
[sighs]

19
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,760
I bet they're in
that big fucker's pocket.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
OK, well, why don't
we get help from somewhere?

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,159
Help's over an hour away.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,480
There's only one 
option for me.
