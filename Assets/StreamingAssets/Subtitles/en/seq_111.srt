1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,120
Fucking hell. A beta like you can't 
have risen very far in the army ranks.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,839
Beta?

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,519
You know what a beta is. 
The opposite of an alpha.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,320
A follower, not a leader.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,560
A typical nice guy. You.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Well, my nonna taught 
me to be respectful.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I bet she did.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,559
Bet she also taught you any 
girl would be lucky to have you.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,280
[snorts]

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,480
Textbook.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
[sighs]

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,120
Tell me about 
your last relationship.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,719
Come on.

14
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,519
Ok...

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,240
We met online. 
It started great.

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,960
We were very different,
but opposites attract, right?

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,560
[chuckles]

18
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,880
But then she started telling me 
too much about her past relationships.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,119
How they treated her badly. 
But that made her want more.

20
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,119
... and that wasn't a 
red flag for you.

21
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,320
No, I respected her past.

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,719
I wanted to be
different and treat her well.

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,479
So, you just accepted 
everything she said and did,

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,159
even though you 
didn't like it.

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,560
I didn't want 
to ruin things.

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,719
Right. 
So, how did it end?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,799
- She cheated on me.
- [laughs]

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,400
Many times.

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,680
Voila! 
See, your nonna's right.

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,760
Women will settle
for a beta male,

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,280
right after they've fucked a bunch
of big-dicked alphas first.

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,680
Hey, I helped you.

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,439
Eurgh.
Don't do that.

34
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,000
That behavior.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,719
You're looking for gratitude.

36
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,159
It's a prime beta move. 
It's very unattractive.

37
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,719
What?

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Aw, did I hurt 
your feelings?

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Aw, come on. 
Say what you want to say.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,640
I've been called it all.

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,000
A narcissist, 
a sociopath, a gaslighter.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,400
A cunt?

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,079
I know that car.

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
The road manager 
and his wife.

45
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,719
[speaking Italian]

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
[gunshot]
[glass crack]

47
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,360
[gunshot]
[glass crack]

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,879
[gunshots]

49
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,159
Come on.
