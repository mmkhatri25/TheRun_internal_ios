1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,480
Yeah, ok.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,280
But this is about the kid, 
not about the charity or the parents.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,919
Thank you. 
You're a saint.

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,160
Yeah, I know.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,039
- The kid's name is Grace.
- Got it.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,679
Hey, Grace!

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,000
[heavy breaths] 
Zanna Hendricks!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
How are you?

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,120
A lot better 
now you're here.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,559
Sorry I'm sleepy.

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,239
I stayed up 
to meet you.

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,600
Aww, I hear you're a big
fan. I'm on this amazing run.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,240
You are gonna love it.
It's gonna be my best one yet.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm so excited!

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,759
You've taught me 
to keep positive

17
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,320
and I've gotten stronger.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,200
Well, I'm always 
there for you.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,119
I want to start 
running soon but...

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,119
... the doctors are 
telling me 'no'.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Where are you now?

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,359
Well, I'm just on a 
break at the moment

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,359
but I'm gonna get 
right back into it.

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,359
Cool.

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,600
... and who's that 
behind you?

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
Uh. I will catch 
you soon.

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,840
It was so nice 
talking to you.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,760
Thank you so much, Zanna.

29
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,799
[door creaks open]

30
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,000
[calming exhale]

31
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,439
- [bolt flies past]
- Ah!

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,879
What the f...

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
- [bolt flies past]
- Ah!

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,719
[panting]
