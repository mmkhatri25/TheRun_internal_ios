Eurgh!

00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Fuck.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Nonna!

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Nonna!

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320

Fuck!

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,479
Jesus Christ!

16
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,919
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

17
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah, well, I didn't.

19
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,639
Put the fucking knife away.

20
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,639
Right...

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,919
<i>One new video message </i>

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Matteo, slow down a sec.

23
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,319
- Zan!
- Hey Zan!

24
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,080
Yo, so we are 
riding home.

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,360
Well, I didn't get the 
tattoo in the end but

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
we got these instead.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,960
[laughs]

28
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,599
So, listen. I just
want to say - I love you.

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,879
Even though, like, I
never get to see you anymore

30
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,199
because, like, you're
busy breaking the internet.

31
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,599
But you deserve 
that success, right?

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
Stay on the grind, sis.

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,599
Oh and thank you so 
much for the money.

34
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,759
As you can 
see, we are

35
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,719
riding home in style 
thanks to you.

36
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,879
- Woo! 
- Woo!

37
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,639
Who's the party boy?

38
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,240
My brother, Cliff.

39
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,759
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

40
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,280
You know the type.

41
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,240
He'll go far.

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,719
... and you aren't positive?

43
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,719
No, I am when I 
need to be.

44
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,719
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

45
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,360
Your earphones stayed in?

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,039
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

47
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm the brand's ambassador.

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,879
I get five figures 
every time I say

49
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

50
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Nice.

51
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,000
Nonna!

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,199
You trying to 
get us killed?!

54
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,479
Sorry.
