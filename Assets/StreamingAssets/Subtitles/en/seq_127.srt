1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,040
The trail is the only 
certainty we have.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,839
Keep your eyes open.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,440
Come on.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,960
Ok.

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,160
Ok, listen to me.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,640
Pain is just a sensation 
that your brain creates

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,399
to tell your body 
something's wrong.

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,600
You just need a 
distraction, that's all.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,559
Um...

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,480
Oh, you can 
answer a riddle.

11
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,600
Ok, I've got one. Um...

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,079
What keeps you young?

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,160
- What? That's it?
- Yeah. Come on.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Um...

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,520
Travel?

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,399
No.

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,799
Oh God. Love?

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,079
No.

19
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,079
Experiences?

20
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,359
No, not even close. 
Come on.

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,560
I give up.

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
No, no, no. 
Don't give up. Come on.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,960
You got this.

24
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Think outside the box. 
Come on.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,799
The letters 'N' and 'G'.

26
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,640
What?!

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
It's a trick question.

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,320
Never mind.

29
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,399
Argh. God.

30
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,280
Wait, wait. I need to rest.

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,719
Oh God...

32
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,159
Listen, Matteo. We can't
rest out in the open like this.

33
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,840
We need to find cover.

34
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,359
There.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,319
Oh yeah.

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,920
A scary-looking fort.

37
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,560
Why not?

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,359
Come on then.
Come on.

39
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,120
So, does someone actually 
look after this place?

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Yeah.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,919
A husband and wife.

42
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,719
They hate me, too.

43
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,560
[beathing heavily]

44
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,520
If it's any consolation...

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
You're a better 
Catholic than me.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,159
[pained laugh]

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,319
He's here. Come on.

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,960
This place is 
like a maze.

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
We can lose him 
if we're smart.

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,159
Oh fuck.

51
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,680
Fuck, he's already 
been here.

52
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,360
... and it looks like 
he's got us cornered.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Yeah, so we 
got to face him.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,159
With what?

55
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,560
Some dust sheets 
and a broom?

56
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,360
Oh shit.

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,439
Any ideas?
