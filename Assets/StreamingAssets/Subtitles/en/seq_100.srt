00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:07,919
Nonna!

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Nonna!

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,039
[branch crunch]

4
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,239
Nonna!

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,480
[shuts door]

6
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,079
[breaths of relief]

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,399
Ok...

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,079
[gasping]

9
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,799
[engine flooding]

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
[engine flooding]

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Fuck!

12
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,359
Jesus Christ!

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,799
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

14
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,439
Yeah, well, I didn't.

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,520
Put the fucking knife away.

17
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Right...

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
<i>One new video message </i>
<i>from 'Clifford Hendricks'.</i>

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,879
Matteo, slow down a sec.

20
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
- Zan!
- Hey Zan!

21
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,960
Yo, so we are 
riding home.

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
Well, I didn't get the 
tattoo in the end but

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
we got these instead.

24
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,840
[laughs]

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,479
So, listen. I just
want to say - I love you.

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,759
Even though, like, I
never get to see you anymore

27
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,080
because, like, you're
busy breaking the internet.

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,479
But you deserve 
that success, right?

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
Stay on the grind, sis.

30
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,479
Oh and thank you so 
much for the money.

31
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,639
As you can 
see, we are

32
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,599
riding home in style 
thanks to you.

33
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,759
- Woo! 
- Woo!

34
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,520
Who's the party boy?

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
My brother, Cliff.

36
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,639
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

37
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,159
You know the type.

38
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
He'll go far.

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,599
... and you aren't positive?

40
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
No, I am when I 
need to be.

41
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,599
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

42
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,240
Your earphones stayed in?

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,919
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

44
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm the brand's ambassador.

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,759
I get five figures 
every time I say

46
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,560
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Nice.

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,879
Nonna!

49
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,280
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,080
You trying to 
get us killed?!

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Sorry.
