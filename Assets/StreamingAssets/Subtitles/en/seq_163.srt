00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,279
It's not for 
us to decide.

2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,240
Watch that wire!

3
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,679
Got it.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,320
Hey, stop!

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,159
Zanna!

6
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:36,960
Stop!

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,439
Can you hear that?

8
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,039
No...

9
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,600
[distant church bell]

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
There is life in Libitina.

11
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,719
Here.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,840

13
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,079

[church bell]

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,079
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,680
We need to warn them.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

18
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,319
<i>and women</i>

19
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,359
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

20
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,599
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

[doors opening]

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,400
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

25
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,080
<i>The final purification</i>

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,080
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

27
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,360
Matteo...

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Nonna?

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,319
Matteo, wait!
