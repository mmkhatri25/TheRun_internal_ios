<i>Our souls must suffer</i>

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,320
<i>Wake up!</i>

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
<i>This...</i>

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,719
<i>... is the word of God.</i>

Matteo!

00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,759
My brave boy.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,560
What the fuck 
is going on?!

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,960
<i>So guys, I've finally </i>
<i>made it to Libitina.</i>

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
From what I can see, 
which is not a lot,

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
it's really beautiful!

17
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,840
But let me tell you...

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
These mountain 
roads are crazy.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,200
There's no streelights, nothing--

00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,599
<i>... hanging in the barn.</i>

26
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>In this moment,</i>

27
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,400
<i>you are on a middle plane.</i>

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>A place which offers salvation </i>

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,480
<i>... in the form of a test.</i>

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,959
Bullshit!

31
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,680
<i>Purgatory?</i>

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Yes!

33
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>It is a test you </i>

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Yeah, come this way!

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
<i>Thanks to your actions here,</i>

36

<i>You shall now...</i>

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,039
<i>... ascend.</i>

41

<i>Selfishness.</i>

[crowd cheering]

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,879
I ran...

51
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
... and I shouldn't have run.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,319
You're a good person, Zanna.

53
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,919
You've done enough 
to be saved.

54
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,639
Am I?

55
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
Oh my God.

- Let's go.
- Wait, wait. You can't leave him.

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,240
He doesn't want our help.

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,439
But it's wrong.

62
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,680
It's wrong?

Come on...

My beautiful baby brother.

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,319
You were right.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,920
Life is to be lived.

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,560
Wake up!

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,240
I am going to give you one
last motivational speech

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,759
So, you listen to me.

You keep fighting, ok?

[tearful]
Keep fighting!

80
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,600
Because you need more time 
to spread your amazing energy.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
So just keep, keep going.

82
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,959
Keep fighting... for me.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Please... because I love you.
