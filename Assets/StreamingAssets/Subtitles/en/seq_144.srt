1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,080
Yeah, you're right.

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,360
We don't know 
anything, do we?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,359
I can't even be sure
that you're not one of them.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,279
- What?
- How can I trust you Matteo?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
I helped you kill 
one of them!

6
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,760
[panting]

7
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,560
Come on.

8
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm so sorry. It's my fault. 
I shouldn't have stopped.

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
It's fine.

10
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,719
He would've stabbed 
us both. He was fast.

11
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,920
Come on.

12
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,519
Come on!

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
[heavy panting]

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,439
All right. I can't keep 
up the tough guy act.

15
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,439
Please, can we rest?

16
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,239
Ok...

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Ok... but just 
for a minute.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
[panting]

19
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,640
You've always 
been a strong Catholic?

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
Not always.

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,719
I'm trying to improve.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,439
I'm a coward.

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,159
Come on. 
You're not a coward.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,239
You were a soldier. You wear
those stupid boots all the time.

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,400
I was discharged 
with dishonor.

26
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,719
Why?

27
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,599
Desertion.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
It haunts me every day.

29
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,319
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,199
We've stayed too long. 
Time to go. Come on.

31
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,199
[grunts]

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,599
Argh. He's too fast. 
He'll get us.

33
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,400
No. Come on. 
We can outrun him!

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,199
Leave me, Zanna! Please.
