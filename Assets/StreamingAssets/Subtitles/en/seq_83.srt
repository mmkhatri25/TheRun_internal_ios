00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,159
[slap impact]

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:01,639
Ow.

3
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,640
You shouldn't sneak 
up on people like that.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,080
Where's your key?!

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,320
There's no crime around here.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,879
What? So, how do 
you lock the doors?

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,280
- I don't.
- What?

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,839
Wanna tell me 
what's going on?

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,239
Yeah, I borrowed some 
of your wife's clothes.

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,600
[chuckles] 
My wife?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,399
Yeah, I didn't think 
she'd mind.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,839
Don't worry, your 
secret's safe with me.

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,600
No, those are 
my nonna's clothes.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
I told you about 
her this morning.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,079
Anyway, why would 
you need them?

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,079
Because mine made me
look like a big pink target.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
Where is your nonna?

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
She went for a run.

19
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,320
Matteo, I am running 
from a killer.

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,399
[chuckles]

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,399
Your nonna is 
in serious danger.

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,240
Nothing bad ever 
happens out here.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,359
Look, I don't know
what's going on either.

24
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,760
You want me to run into
the woods and leave you here alone.

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,359
What the fuck would I
steal from a farm, you idiot?!

26
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,040
Matteo!

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,200
Matteo, you have 
to believe me.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,359
Show me proof!

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,159
Ah!

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,599
Just wait... 

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,719
<i>Holy shit, guys.</i>

32
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>This is turning into </i>
<i>a mass murder.</i>

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,599
The road manager 
and his wife...

34
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,879
You see?

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,280
I don't see any killers.

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,159
Are you fucking serious?!

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,040
Obviously, I didn't do this!

38
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,239
Please leave, Zanna.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
What?

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,319
I said, leave!

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,719
Matteo, where are you going?!

42
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,280
Matteo!

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,879
Listen to me.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Shit...

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Inside.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,519
Get inside!

47
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,879
Hey!

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Yeah, come this way!

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,599
Shit!

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
