1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,960
Yeah...

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,280
You're right.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,560
Sorry for holding us up.

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,320
It's all right.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
We should get going.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
[sighs]

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,760
[panting]

8
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,560
Come on.

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm so sorry. It's my fault. 
I shouldn't have stopped.

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,399
It's fine.

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,719
He would've stabbed 
us both. He was fast.

12
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,920
Come on.

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,519
Come on!

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
[heavy panting]

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,439
All right. I can't keep 
up the tough guy act.

16
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,439
Please, can we rest?

17
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,239
Ok...

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Ok... but just 
for a minute.

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
[panting]

20
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,640
You've always 
been a strong Catholic?

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
Not always.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,719
I'm trying to improve.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,439
I'm a coward.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,159
Come on. 
You're not a coward.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,239
You were a soldier. You wear
those stupid boots all the time.

26
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,400
I was discharged 
with dishonor.

27
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,719
Why?

28
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,599
Desertion.

29
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,520
It haunts me every day.

30
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,319
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,199
I really need something 
for this pain.

32
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,120
Try these...

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,560
These are herbs 
from the mountain.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,319
They only grow here.

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,120
Well, are they any good?

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Never tried them.

37
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,639
Now's as good 
a time as any.

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,879
We've stayed too long.

39
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,479
Time to go. Come on.

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,879
Watch it. Watch it!

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,319
Come on.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,560
[phone pings]

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,759
Video message 
from Clifford Hendricks.

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,479
Hold on, slow down.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,520
Zanna...

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
Zanna, oh my God...

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,840
Cliff's been in an accident.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,759
We were attacked 
and he defended me,

49
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,759
but they beat 
him up really bad.

50
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
He didn't have any 
money for a taxi,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,120
so, we were walking home
and these guys just like...

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,919
... they just, like, 
jumped us.

53
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,879
They're taking him 
to the hospital.

54
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,879
They're gonna do 
an emergency operation.

55
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,479
These guys that attacked 
us, they were like sickos.

56
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,280
They wore like these, 
I don't know...

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
... these skull masks.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh fuck!

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,159
What?

60
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,879
- What is it? What? 
- Fuck! Come on!

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,919
Shit.

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,639
Go. Go!

63
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,120
Quickly. 
Down here.

64
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,839
Go, go, go.

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Argh!

66
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,879
I need more 
of those herbs.

67
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,879
Shit...

68
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Here.

69
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,480
Finish them.

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Swallow it!

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,519
Ok, good. 
Let's go!

72
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,399
Zanna...

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Stay here.
