1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,960
Yeah...

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,280
You're right.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,560
Sorry for holding us up.

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,320
It's all right.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,000
We should get going.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
[sighs]

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,760
[panting]

8
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,560
Come on.

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm so sorry. It's my fault. 
I shouldn't have stopped.

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,399
It's fine.

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,719
He would've stabbed 
us both. He was fast.

12
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,920
Come on.

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,519
Come on!

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
[heavy panting]

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,439
All right. I can't keep 
up the tough guy act.

16
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,439
Please, can we rest?

17
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,239
Ok...

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Ok... but just 
for a minute.

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
[panting]

20
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,640
You've always 
been a strong Catholic?

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
Not always.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,719
I'm trying to improve.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,439
I'm a coward.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,159
Come on. 
You're not a coward.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,239
You were a soldier. You wear
those stupid boots all the time.

26
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,400
I was discharged 
with dishonor.

27
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,719
Why?

28
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,599
Desertion.

29
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,520
It haunts me every day.

30
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,319
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,199
I really need something 
for this pain.

32
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,120
Try these...

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,560
These are herbs 
from the mountain.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,319
They only grow here.

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,120
Well, are they any good?

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Never tried them.

37
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,639
Now's as good 
a time as any.

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,879
We've stayed too long.

39
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,479
Time to go. Come on.

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,879
Watch it. Watch it!

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Shit!

42
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Go!

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Move!

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,879
Quickly. 
Down here.

45
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,599
Go, go, go.

46
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,319
Argh!

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,639
I need more 
of those herbs.

48
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
Shit...

49
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
Here.

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,240
Finish them.

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,759
Swallow it!

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,279
Ok, good. 
Let's go!

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Zanna...

54
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
Stay here.
