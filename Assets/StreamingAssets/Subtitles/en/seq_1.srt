00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,359
Could your belt 
be any janglier?

6
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, sorry.
[chuckles]

7
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,400
It was my <i>nonno's</i>.

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,120
I started wearing it
after I took over the farm.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
Mm.

10
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,079
Or did you want...

11
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,239
...morning sex?

12
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,959
No.

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,480
I've got to conserve 
my energy.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,000
Right, yeah. 
I figured.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,480
Ah! I got my <i>nonna</i> this 
set for her birthday.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,560
You can spot it a mile off.

18
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,239
You've mentioned both 
your grandparents

20
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,480
Shit. 
Sorry, Zanna.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,439
You remembered my name.

22
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,200
Thanks for last night.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Um.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
There's not a lot of
people to do that without here.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Did you have a good time?

Do you want feedback?

27
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh my god, Matteo.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,120
Hey, you remembered 
my name too.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,519
Well, only the locals 
call me Matteo, though.

30
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,680
I was 'Matt' back home.

31
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,560
So, if you want 
to call me that.

32
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,840
Or... Matteo works.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,039
You know...

34
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,639
Either.
