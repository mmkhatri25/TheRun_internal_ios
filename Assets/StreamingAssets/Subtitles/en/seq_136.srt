00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Let's check out the battery.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,000
Ok, this way.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,399
They've already been here.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,399
Who were they?

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,799
They looked after 
this place. They...

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,119
... they helped anyone 
who came here.

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,039
[screaming]

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,039
[match lighting]

9
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,880
[fire ignites]

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,040
[intense screaming]

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,799
They were my friends.

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,439
I'm sorry, Matteo.

13
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,719
Um...

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,359
The toilet's inside.

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
You're kidding me.

16
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,080
You said there 
was a proper toilet.

17
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,439
Out here, that is one.

18
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,240
Go on.

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,960
I'll stand guard.

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Thanks.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,280
[gasping]

22
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,120
Matteo, you...

23
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,360
<i>Zanna! </i>
<i>I found something!</i>

24
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,319
Shit.

25
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,639
Matteo, are you 
fucking serious?!

26
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,439
<i>Yeah, it's a shortcut!</i>

27
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,479
I can't fucking 
see anything...

28
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,840
Matteo!

29
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,759
Matteo!
