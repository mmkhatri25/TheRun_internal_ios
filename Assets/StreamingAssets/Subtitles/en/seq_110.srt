1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,800
Look, I know she 
means a lot to you,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,480
but we have to be clever
and we have to be careful, ok?

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,480
[sighs]

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:06,799
Ok?

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,880
Yeah, of course. 
You're right.

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,599
Ok, let's go.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
[sighs]

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,920
So, was your nonna 
always into fitness?

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,199
Yeah, she played
sports with me all my life.

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,160
Ate healthy, too.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,039
My nonna, not so much.

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,799
Smoking got him.

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,799
She kept begging 
him to stop.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,880
... and he never did.
In the end, she was right.

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,719
As always.

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,119
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,000
She sounds like a
woman after my own heart.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
I know that car.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
The road manager 
and his wife.

20
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,480
[speaking Italian]

21
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,280
[gunshot]
[glass crack]

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,120
[gunshot]
[glass crack]

23
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,640
[gunshots]

24
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,920
Come on.
