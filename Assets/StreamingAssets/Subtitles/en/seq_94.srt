1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,560
Hey!

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,719
[screams]

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,359
[strong impact]

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,160
[screams]

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,000
[grunting]

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,359
[screams]

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,159
[piercing sound]

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,359
[panting]

9
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,759
That was my nanno's.

10
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,560
Been busted for years.

11
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,879
Damn.

12
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,719
Is this him?

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Yeah.

14
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,359
They both gave 
their all for me.

15
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,439
Now I'm out here just
trying to do the same for them.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
A rosary?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,400
You're Catholic, huh?

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Mm-hm.

19
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,959
I'm a stronger believing
 now than before.

20
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,359
Really?

21
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,319
Put it on.

22
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,040
We need all the 
help we can get.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,519
We don't know how many
of those fuckers are out there.

24
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,879
Doesn't matter.

25
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,680
I'm finding my nonna.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,120
Do you always do
everything in those boots?

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,319
Pretty much.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm ex-army.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,359
Even running?

30
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,359
Yeah.

31
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,000
We'd run for miles in these.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Fair enough.

33
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,760
So, what route does
your 'nanna' usually take?

34
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,879
Well, there's no 'usual'.

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Sometimes she takes the
north trail, sometimes the south.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
She says 'hello' to
her friends in Libitina.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,520
Then she takes the other 
trail on the way back home.

38
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,240
So which trail 
did you take?

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,159
The south.

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
But I didn't see 
any sign of her.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
Then we'll take 
the north trail.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
So, how long does 
she usually take?

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,039
Six hours.

44
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,080
She's fast for 85.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Jesus.

46
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,919
No wonder she features
so heavily in your pillow talk.

47
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,680
[door opens]

48
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,319
- Zan!
- Hey Zanna!

49
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,800
So we are 
walking home.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,319
Well, I didn't get 
the tattoo in the end.

51
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
But guess what?
I got this instead...

52
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,400
Sexy as fuck.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,199
So listen, I 
just wanna say -

54
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,680
I love you.

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,560
Even though I never get 
to see you anymore because

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,800
you're, I don't know, 
busy breaking the internet.

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
But you deserve that success.

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,080
- Tell her.
- You do, you really do.

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,599
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,240
Stay on the grind, sis!

61
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,479
Oh, and no hard feelings 
about the money.

62
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,800
Tough love, like, I get it.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
[laughs]

64
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,400
Who's the party boy?

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,520
My brother, Cliff. 
Watch your step...

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,919
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
You know the type.

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,240
He'll go far.

69
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
... and you aren't positive?

70
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,560
Yeah, when I need to be.

71
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,199
Come on, let's 
pick up the pace.

72
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,879
Your earphones 
have stayed in.

73
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,879
Yeah, I actually forget 
they're in half the time.

74
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,079
I'm an ambassador 
for the company.

75
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,800
I get five figures 
every time I say

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
they're best sports 
earphones money can buy.

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
- Nice. 
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Nonna!

79
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,319
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

80
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,879
You trying to 
get us killed?!

81
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm sorry.
