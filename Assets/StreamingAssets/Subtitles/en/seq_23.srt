00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,520
Oh my God.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,399
[panting]

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
Ok.

6
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,600
Hey guys, I am just 
checking in because

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,119
running an unfamiliar
trail has got me super jumpy.

8
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,439
... and I need a distraction.

9
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,079
I, uh, I just got spooked by 
an old man and his dog.

10
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,239
Can you believe that?

11
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,640
Anyway...

12
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,879
I should have...

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,400
... I should have passed 
them by now but...

[dog barking]

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,079
Oh, that's the dog.

[barking continues]

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,480
Can you hear that?

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,280
[distressed barking]

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,920
Sounds distressed, right?

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,319
[barking continues]

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
