1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,080
Ok.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,320
This one, let's go.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,480
- You okay?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,199
Jesus...

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
You okay?

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, just not used
to sitting on jagged rocks.

7
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,159
Let me...

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,600
What are you doing?!

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,600
Ok...

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,280
You would risk 
us getting caught

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
just to give me 
a comfy seat?

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,600
Hey, can I ask 
you some advice?

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,719
Yes, it's the one 
thing I can give.

14
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,960
The next time 
I meet a woman...

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,760
... what do I need to do to
make myself more...

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,159
... attractive?

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,359
Well.

18
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,400
I think it's about 
mutual respect.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
... and being your 
own man.

20
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,239
Don't put someone 
on a pedestal.

21
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,640
At least, not until 
they've earned it.

22
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,519
But most importantly,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,799
know your value.

24
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,920
You don't need 
my advice, Matteo.

25
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,920
You're a very cool guy.

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
No.

27
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,560
No, I'm not.

28
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm a coward.

29
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,079
Do you really 
believe that?

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,760
Or is it just because
your buddy back there said so?

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,959
You're both ex-army, right?

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,639
Why was he 
hating on you?

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,199
Not the same army.

34
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,840
I served America, 
not Italy like him.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
That's why he 
called me a traitor.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,039
As for me 
being a coward,

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
I was discharged 
with dishonor.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
Why?

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,199
Desertion.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
It haunts me every day.

41
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,960
[distant footsteps]

42
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,199
Shit...

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,680
He's gonna check 
in here next.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
He might not.

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,439
Do you want to 
take that risk?!

46
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,039
What else can we do?!

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,879
Don't move...
