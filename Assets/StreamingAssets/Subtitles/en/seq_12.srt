1
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
[crowd cheering]

2
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,120
That's my sister!

3
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,000
Go Zanna!

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,560
- Cliff!
- Go Zanna!

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,959
Runners, set!

6
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,040
[gun fires]

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,799
Hey guys, it's me!

8
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,120
 So, I've just begun my run 
and I feel amazing.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
The air out here is incredible.

10
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,080
No wonder Libitina has
the highest life expectancy

11
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,400
in Europe.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
Everyone here is like 85+. 
It's giving vampire.

13
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,319
It is a little bit isolated 
but with views like this?

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Seriously.

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,639
Who cares?

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Hey guys, you won't
believe what I just found

17
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,840
at the start of my trail.

18
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,599
Garotte wire.

19
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,479
For those of you who 
don't know what it is,

20
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,400
it's used in hunting 
to maim prey,

21
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,759
or in warfare 
to kill stealthily.

22
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,560
Either way, it's not 
great to find

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
at the beginning 
of my trail.
