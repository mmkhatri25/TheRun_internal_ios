[stab in back]

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,320
[gasping for air]

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Matteo!

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Come on! Come on,
we must be so close now.

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
- Come on.
- I've lost too much blood.

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,239
I...

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
No, come on. You can
do this, you can do this!

9
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,840
Argh...

10
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,920
[phone pings]

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,519
Video message from 
Clifford Hendricks.

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Shit...

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Zanna...

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,199
Zanna, oh my God...

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,360
Cliff's been in an accident.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
We were attacked 
and he defended me,

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
but they beat 
him up really bad.

18
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,400
He didn't have any 
money for a taxi,

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,960
so, we were walking home
and these guys just like...

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,759
... they just, like, 
jumped us.

21
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,439
They're taking him 
to the hospital.

22
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,520
They're gonna do 
an emergency operation.

23
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,639
These guys that attacked 
us, they were like sickos.

24
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,800
They wore like these, 
I don't know...

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,599
... these skull masks.

26
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,560
[wimpers]

27
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh fuck! Fuck!

28
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,080
Come on!

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
[gasps]

30
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,400
Get away from him.

31
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,599
[muffled dialogue]

32
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,439
[muffled dialogue]

33
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,439
What are you saying? 
I can't hear...

34
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,719
[distant church bell]

35
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,520
Matteo? Matteo...

36
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,840
I feel a lot better.

37
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,719
Weird.

38
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
On your feet.

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
The bells...

40
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,319
Yes.

41
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,639
There is life in Libitina.

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go!

43
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,919

44
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,039

[church bell]

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,439
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

47
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,040
We need to warn them.

48
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

49
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,680
<i>and women</i>

50
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,720
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

51
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,360
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

52
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,959
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,720
[doors opening]

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,360
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

55
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,759
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,439
<i>The final purification</i>

57
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,439
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

58
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,720
Matteo...

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Nonna?

60
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
Matteo, wait!
