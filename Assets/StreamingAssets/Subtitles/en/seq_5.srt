1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,480
Oh... ok.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,799
[spit hits glass]

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,640
Jesus Christ.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,000
What a welcome!

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,120
A very good morning, everybody.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,519
How are you?

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,399
Please excuse the mess 
that is my face.

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,920
I haven't slept because
I've been traveling all night.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,840
This week's 'Run Diary' is
gonna be a goddamn special one!

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,240
Because I am 
celebrating reaching...

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,520
Drum roll, please...

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,359
[Drum roll sound]

13
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,320
Five million followers!

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,000
And it's all thanks 
to you guys.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,799
So, I have travelled 
to the Veneto...

16
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,399
... or 'Veneto' region 
of Northern Italy.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,280
And let me 
tell you something.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,399
The drive from 
the airport alone,

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,399
was absolutely breathtaking.

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,640
One minute, I was
driving along Lake Garda

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,560
and the next minute, 
I was on Monte Baldo.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,359
And now, I am in this little
remote village called Libitina,

23
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,000
which is world-famous 
for its running trails.

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,879
So guys, I am gonna 
finish getting ready

25
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,239
and do something about this.

26
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,079
... and I'm gonna catch
you on my running trail.

27
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,480
[blows kiss]
Bye.

28
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,840
Good morning, Zanna.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,760
I see you are 
in a new location.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,159
Do you need navigation?

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,400
Not today, Miri.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Awesome.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Ciao.
