00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,600
[snorts]

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,200
Well, I wasn't gonna
wear your grimey shit, was I?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,039
Did you lock the door?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Uh...

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,199
Where's your key?!

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,440
There's no crime around here.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,000
What? So, how do 
you lock the doors?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,399
- I don't.
- What?

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,960
Wanna tell me 
what's going on?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,359
Yeah, I borrowed some 
of your wife's clothes.

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,719
[chuckles] 
My wife?

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,520
Yeah, I didn't think 
she'd mind.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Don't worry, your 
secret's safe with me.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
No, those are 
my nonna's clothes.

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,399
I told you about 
her this morning.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,200
Anyway, why would 
you need them?

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Because mine made me
look like a big pink target.

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,640
Where is your nonna?

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,039
She went for a run.

20
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,439
Matteo, I am running 
from a killer.

21
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,520
[chuckles]

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Your nonna is 
in serious danger.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,359
Nothing bad ever 
happens out here.

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,480
Look, I don't know
what's going on either.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,879
You want me to run into
the woods and leave you here alone.

26
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,480
What the fuck would I
steal from a farm, you idiot?!

27
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,159
Matteo!

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,319
Matteo, you have 
to believe me.

29
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,480
Show me proof!

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Ah!

31
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,719
Just wait... 

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,840
<i>Holy shit, guys.</i>

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,920
<i>This is turning into </i>
<i>a mass murder.</i>

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,719
The road manager 
and his wife...

35
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,000
You see?

36
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,400
I don't see any killers.

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,280
Are you fucking serious?!

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,159
Obviously, I didn't do this!

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,359
Please leave, Zanna.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
What?

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,439
I said, leave!

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Matteo, where are you going?!

43
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,400
Matteo!

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Listen to me.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Shit...

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,879
Inside.

47
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,639
Get inside!

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey!

49
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah, come this way!

50
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,719
Shit!

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
