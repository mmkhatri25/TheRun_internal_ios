00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,360
Hi.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,039
Oh! Thank you.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,960
I mean... <i>grazie</i>.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,519
<i>Ciao</i>.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,919
Oh. <i>Ciao</i>!

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,880
Hopefully that'll 
cure a hangover.

7
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,600
Please be legal...

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
A very good morning, everybody.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,719
How are you?

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,600
Please excuse the mess 
that is my face.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,119
I haven't slept because
I've been traveling all night.

12
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,039
This week's 'Run Diary' is
gonna be a goddamn special one!

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,439
Because I am 
celebrating reaching...

14
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,719
Drum roll, please...

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,560
[Drum roll sound]

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,519
Five million followers!

17
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,200
And it's all thanks 
to you guys.

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,000
So, I have travelled 
to the Veneto...

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,599
... or 'Veneto' region 
of Northern Italy.

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,480
And let me 
tell you something.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,599
The drive from 
the airport alone,

22
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,599
was absolutely breathtaking.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,840
One minute, I was
driving along Lake Garda

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,760
and the next minute, 
I was on Monte Baldo.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,560
And now, I am in this little
remote village called Libitina,

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,200
which is world-famous 
for its running trails.

27
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,079
So guys, I am gonna 
finish getting ready

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,439
and do something about this.

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,280
... and I'm gonna catch
you on my running trail.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,680
[blows kiss]
Bye.

31
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,040
Good morning, Zanna.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,959
I see you are 
in a new location.

33
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,359
Do you need navigation?

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,599
Not today, Miri.

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,319
Awesome.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Ciao.
