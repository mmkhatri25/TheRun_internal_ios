1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,879
I am making sure he 
never follows us again.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,839
Come on.

3
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,840
The toll woman usually 
stands outside this hut.

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
Yeah, well, not today.

5
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,079
Wait, stop!

6
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,560
Can you hear that?

7
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,359
No.

8
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,319
[distant church bell]

9
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,879
There is life in Libitina.

10
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,519
Here.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,239
Come on.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,439
[distant church bell]

13
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,840
[distant church bell]

14
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,039
[church bell ringing]

15
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,000
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
We need to warn them.

17
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Matteo, wait.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
I want to tell 
you something.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,360
I don't remember how 
we met or what we did.

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,159
I just...

21
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,159
... remember waking 
up with you.

22
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,439
... and

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,479
I'm really glad we did.

24
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,199
Same.

25
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,159
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

26
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,759
<i>and women</i>

27
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,800
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

28
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,479
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

29
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,000
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
[doors opening]

31
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,479
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

32
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,879
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

33
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,560
<i>The final purification</i>

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,560
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

35
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,840
Matteo...

36
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,039
Nonna?

37
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,800
Matteo, wait!
