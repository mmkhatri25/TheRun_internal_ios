00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
You always wanted 
to be a vlogger?

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,039
Not exactly.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,960
I was a really 
good youth runner,

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,280
but I wasn't the best.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,480
What?

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,039
... and you need 
to be the best?

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,640
Yeah, of course.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,799
So, I pivoted to
online health and fitness.

10
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,520
Now I'm just a few million followers
away from being the best.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Must take a lot of discipline 
to film your every move.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,799
Yeah, good Catholic discipline.

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,119
You're Catholic too?

14
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,960
Not so much now, but 
the discipline was instilled

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,520
- in me at a young age.
- By who?

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,280
Sorry, you probably
told me all this last night,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,759
but I don't remember a thing.

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,479
Didn't realize I 
got that wasted.

19
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,079
Yeah, me either.

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,879
Although, I have an excuse.

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,959
Jet lag and a six and a
half hour drive to get here.

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,599
So, you're a 
role model, huh?

23
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,280
[laughs]

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,519
I guess.

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,799
It feels weird 
saying that out loud.

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,599
But I've never really understood 
why somebody would follow

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,719
somebody who can do
something that they can't.

28
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,319
But it is what it is, and if I 
don't do it, somebody else will.

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,519
Well, keep going.

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,879
Someday you might be able
to retire out here in Libitina.

31
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,359
[laughs]
Yeah.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
So, what about you?

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,480
You're not into social media?

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Nah, signal's shit out here.
There's no point.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,000
Why don't you just leave?

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,079
You're too young to 
be here anyway.

37
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,159
I chose to be here.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,079
Yeah, but why?

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
Obligation to your grandparents?

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I wanted 
to better myself.

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
Work on that Catholic discipline.

42
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,159
Jesus, your nonna 
must have had

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,280
ankles of steel to 
run this every day.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
So listen, this is 
slightly awkward but

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,000
are you so Catholic that
you didn't use a condom last night?

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,400
Uh...

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
I don't know.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Jesus, why can't 
we remember?

49
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,159
Who lives there?

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,199
Just a crazy old guy.

51
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,280
[gunshot]

52
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,560
Shit!

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh god...

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,639
[gunshot]

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,560
Winchester 243.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,439
The rifle.

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
I can hear it.

58
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,520
It holds five rounds.

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,439
You've got a few 
seconds between shots.

60
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,280
[gunshot]

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,039
Go!

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
[gun reload]

63
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,680
Shit.

64
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,840
[gunshot]

65
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,400
Oh, whoa, whoa! 
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

66
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,039
I'm just a runner.

67
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,599
<i>Who did I shoot?</i>

68
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,479
<i>Tell me!</i>

69
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,080
I don't understand...

70
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,039
Uh...

71
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,240
American.

72
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,080
My friend... he's hurt.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,199
He needs medicine.

74
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you have 
any medicine?

75
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,000
Ok...

76
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,160
[pained grunting]

77
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,319
Ah! <i>Che cazzo</i>!

78
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,920
Calm down.

79
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,680
<i>You're wasting 12 year old single malt</i>

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,600
<i>on a traitor and a coward.</i>

81
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,800
What did he say?

82
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,399
Just insults.

83
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,959
I told you he's crazy.

84
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,480
<i>You're lucky my bullet </i>
<i>skimmed past you.</i>

85
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,160
[pained chuckle]

86
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,879
Tell him-- listen.

87
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,160
Next, I'll pull that 
bolt out of you--

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,959
No.

89
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,480
<i>It's pierced my lung.</i>

90
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,560
<i>I'll suffocate on my own </i>
<i>blood if you pull it out.</i>

91
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
<i>What happened to you?</i>

92
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,439
<i>I was leaving for a morning hunt...</i>

93
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
He says an attacker shot him 
and left him to die like an animal.

94
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,879
Which one was it?

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,319
<i>What colour was their mask?</i>

96
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,079
<i>It was...</i>

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,839
<i>... white like bone.</i>

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,879
Do you have a landline? 
A telephone that

99
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,800
we can call for help?

100
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,879
<i>They cut the phone line.</i>

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,720
<i>The hunter became </i>
<i>the hunted.</i>

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,839
<i>I'm going to </i>
<i>die a cliche...</i>

103
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,399
<i>... but I've got one bullet </i>
<i>left for that bastard.</i>

104
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,279
<b>One bullet is enough.</b>

105
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,759
<i>You are from Libitina.</i>

106
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,759
<i>Everyone here knows </i>
<i>how to beat death.</i>

107
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,319
<i>Trust someone who served </i>
<i>this country for 40 years.</i>

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,399
<i>The reaper comes </i>
<i>for us all.</i>

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,839
<i>No matter how </i>
<i>fast or far...</i>

110
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,199
<i>... you run.</i>

111
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,560
Ok, listen.
Tell him...

112
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,279
When we get back to Libitina, 
we're going to send help. Ok?

113
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,399
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait. You can't leave him.

114
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,560
What are you talking about?
He doesn't want our help.

115
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,879
But it's wrong.

116
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,240
It's wrong?!

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,560
He's got a gun.

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,879
Better in here 
than out there.

119
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,879
He's got a gun 
with one bullet.

120
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,480
Better than none.
