Fuck.

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,439
<i>Well, I'd rather grow </i>
<i>through success alone.</i>

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,679
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

14
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,240
<i>What made you </i>

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,640
<i>A heartbreak?</i>

Jesus Christ!

27
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,919
What the fuck 
is wrong with you?!

28
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm sorry.
I thought you turned back.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Yeah, well, I didn't.

30
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,639

- Zan!
- Hey Zan!

35
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,080
Yo, so we are 
riding home.

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,360
Well, I didn't get the 
tattoo in the end but

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
we got these instead.

[laughs]

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,599
So, listen. I just
want to say - I love you.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,879
Even though, like, I
never get to see you anymore

41
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,199
because, like, you're
busy breaking the internet.

42
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,599
But you deserve 
that success, right?

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
Stay on the grind, sis.

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,599
Oh and thank you so 
much for the money.

45
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,759
As you can 
see, we are

46
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,719
riding home in style 
thanks to you.

47
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,879
- Woo! 
- Woo!

48
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,639
Who's the party boy?

49
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,240
My brother, Cliff.

50
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,759
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

51
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,280
You know the type.

52
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,240
He'll go far.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,719
... and you aren't positive?

54
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,719
No, I am when I 
need to be.

55
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,719
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

56
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,360
Your earphones stayed in?

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,039
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

58
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm the brand's ambassador.

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,879
I get five figures 
every time I say

60
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Nice.

62
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,000
Nonna!

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,199
You trying to 
get us killed?!

65
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,479
Sorry.
