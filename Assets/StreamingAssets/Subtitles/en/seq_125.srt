Unopened video message 
from Clifford Hendricks.

Zanna... 
Zanna, oh my God...

00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,760
Cliff's been in an accident.

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,519
We were attacked 
and he defended me,

8
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,319
but they beat 
him up really bad.

9
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,199
He didn't have any 
money for a taxi,

10
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,439
so, we were walking home
and these guys just like...

11
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,240
... they just like, 
jumped us.

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,919
They're taking him 
to the hospital.

13
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,919
They're gonna do 
an emergency operation.

14
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,599
These guys that attacked 
us, they were like sickos.

15
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
They wore like these, 
I don't know...

16
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,159
... these skull masks.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,080
Oh my god.

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,879
No. Fuck.

19
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Fuck!

20
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,639
Phone battery drained.

21
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,479
Goodbye, Zanna.

Zanna!

30
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,199
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

31
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
We need to warn them.

32
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
