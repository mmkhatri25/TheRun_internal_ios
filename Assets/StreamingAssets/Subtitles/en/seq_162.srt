00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,640
There's only one way to make 
sure he doesn't follow us again.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,080
You've got the knife...

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
No.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
I can't do it.

5
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,280
Watch that wire!

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,719
Got it.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,359
Hey, stop!

8
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,200
Zanna!

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,000
Stop!

10
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,479
Can you hear that?

11
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,079
No...

12
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,640
[distant church bell]

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,040
There is life in Libitina.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Here.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,879
[distant church bell]

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120
[distant church bell]

17
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,000
[church bell]

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,840
Everybody will be 
inside for Sunday Mass.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,079
We need to warn them.

20
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,280
Matteo, wait.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
I want to tell 
you something.

22
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,200
I don't remember how 
we met or what we did.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
I just...

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
... remember waking 
up with you.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
... and

26
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,239
I'm really glad we did.

27
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,959
Same.

28
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,919
<i>The souls of the just men</i>

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,520
<i>and women</i>

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,560
<i>must be cleansed by</i>

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,240
<i>temporary punishment.</i>

32
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,759
<i>To be admitted into </i>
<i>the eternal country.</i>

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,599
[doors opening]

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
<i>Even the least pains in purgatory</i>

35
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,639
<i>are greater than what ever pain </i>
<i>is imaginable in the world.</i>

36
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,319
<i>The final purification</i>

37
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,319
<i>of the elect after death.</i>

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,599
Matteo...

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Nonna?

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,560
Matteo, wait!
