1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,040
Look, I know how 
much she means to you.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,119
But we got to be clever,
and we got to be careful, ok?

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,480
Yeah, of course.
You're right.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,559
So, was your nonna 
always into fitness?

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,160
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,079
She played sports 
with me all my life.

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,760
Ate healthy, too.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,399
My nonna, not so much.

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,800
Smoking got him.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Sorry.

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,320
She kept begging 
him to stop and...

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,200
... well, in the end,

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
she was right. 
As always.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,960
I am sorry.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,719
But your nonna, she
sounds like my kind of girl.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,079
Come on.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,719
Hey, I got a confession.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,719
What is it, Zanna?

19
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,959
Don't be weird.
It's not a Catholic thing.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,359
I just need the toilet.

21
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,319
We just came 
from the farm.

22
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,120
So? It is what it is.

23
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,319
Well, we can't go back.

24
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,760
We can go through the woods,
or there's an old military battery

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,719
with a proper toilet just beyond 
the perimeter, if you prefer.

26
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,040
All right, well, which one's 
on your nonna's route?

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,079
Well, she uses 
both, but uh,

28
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,640
it's best we 
don't split up.
