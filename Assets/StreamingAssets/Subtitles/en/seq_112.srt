1
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,839
You go.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,200
I'll catch you up.

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,720
Guys, this is 
now a mass murder.

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,879
Zanna.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
What?

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
This is a crime scene. 
It's evidence.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,519
You don't have to present 
it like it's entertainment.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
You always wanted 
to be a vlogger?

9
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,640
Not exactly.

10
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,560
I was a really 
good youth runner,

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,880
but I wasn't the best.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,079
What?

13
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,640
... and you need 
to be the best?

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,239
Yeah, of course.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
So, I pivoted to
online health and fitness.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,120
Now I'm just a few million followers
away from being the best.

17
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,200
Must take a lot of discipline 
to film your every move.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah, good Catholic discipline.

19
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,719
You're Catholic too?

20
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,560
Not so much now, but 
the discipline was instilled

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,120
- in me at a young age.
- By who?

22
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,879
Sorry, you probably
told me all this last night,

23
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,359
but I don't remember a thing.

24
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,079
Didn't realize I 
got that wasted.

25
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,680
Yeah, me either.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Although, I have an excuse.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,560
Jet lag and a six and a
half hour drive to get here.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,200
So, you're a 
role model, huh?

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,879
[laughs]

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,120
I guess.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,400
It feels weird 
saying that out loud.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,200
But I've never really understood 
why somebody would follow

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,319
somebody who can do
something that they can't.

34
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,920
But it is what it is, and if I 
don't do it, somebody else will.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Well, keep going.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Someday you might be able
to retire out here in Libitina.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
[laughs]
Yeah.

38
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,280
So, what about you?

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,079
You're not into social media?

40
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,800
Nah, signal's shit out here.
There's no point.

41
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,599
Why don't you just leave?

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
You're too young to 
be here anyway.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,759
I chose to be here.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Yeah, but why?

45
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,800
Obligation to your grandparents?

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,599
No, I wanted 
to better myself.

47
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,039
Work on that Catholic discipline.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,759
Jesus, your nonna 
must have had

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
ankles of steel to 
run this every day.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So listen, this is 
slightly awkward but

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,599
are you so Catholic that
you didn't use a condom last night?

52
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,000
Uh...

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
I don't know.

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,159
Jesus, why can't 
we remember?

55
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,719
Who lives there?

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,879
Just a crazy old guy.

57
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
No red mark.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,599
- Nonna might be in there.
- Easy, tiger.

59
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,560
We just passed 
two corpses in a car.

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Yeah, they were 
killed hours ago.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,039
When you left my place
this morning, you left by road.

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,319
You would have passed
that car on your way home.

64
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,400
I go a different way.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Really?

66
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,759
Because there's only 
one road on the map.

67
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah, I go off-road.

68
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,759
I helped you kill 
one of them, Zanna.

69
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,599
Shit.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,360
God, I don't know 
what to believe anymore.

71
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,080
[gunshot]

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,199
Get down!

73
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,120
Shit!

74
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
Oh god...

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,159
[gunshot]

76
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,080
Winchester 243.

77
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,960
The rifle.

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,759
I can hear it.

79
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
It holds five rounds.

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
You've got a few 
seconds between shots.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
[gunshot]

82
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,560
Go!

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,879
[gun reload]

84
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,199
Shit.

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
[gunshot]

86
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,920
Oh, whoa, whoa! 
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm just a runner.

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
<i>Who did I shoot?</i>

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
<i>Tell me!</i>

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
I don't understand...

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,560
Uh...

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,759
American.

93
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,600
My friend... he's hurt.

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,720
He needs medicine.

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,519
Do you have 
any medicine?

96
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,519
Ok...

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,680
[pained grunting]

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,839
Ah! <i>Che cazzo</i>!

99
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,439
Calm down.

100
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,199
<i>You're wasting 12 year old single malt</i>

101
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,120
<i>on a traitor and a coward.</i>

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,319
What did he say?

103
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
Just insults.

104
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
I told you he's crazy.

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,000
<i>You're lucky my bullet </i>
<i>skimmed past you.</i>

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
[pained chuckle]

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,399
Tell him-- listen.

108
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,680
Next, I'll pull that 
bolt out of you--

109
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
No.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,000
<i>It's pierced my lung.</i>

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,079
<i>I'll suffocate on my own </i>
<i>blood if you pull it out.</i>

112
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,879
<i>What happened to you?</i>

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,959
<i>I was leaving for a morning hunt...</i>

114
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,759
He says an attacker shot him 
and left him to die like an animal.

115
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,399
Which one was it?

116
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,839
<i>What colour was their mask?</i>

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,600
<i>It was...</i>

118
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,360
<i>... white like bone.</i>

119
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,399
Do you have a landline? 
A telephone that

120
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,319
we can call for help?

121
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,399
<i>They cut the phone line.</i>

122
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,240
<i>The hunter became </i>
<i>the hunted.</i>

123
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,360
<i>I'm going to </i>
<i>die a cliche...</i>

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,920
<i>... but I've got one bullet </i>
<i>left for that bastard.</i>

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
<b>One bullet is enough.</b>

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,279
<i>You are from Libitina.</i>

127
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,279
<i>Everyone here knows </i>
<i>how to beat death.</i>

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,839
<i>Trust someone who served </i>
<i>this country for 40 years.</i>

129
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,920
<i>The reaper comes </i>
<i>for us all.</i>

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,360
<i>No matter how </i>
<i>fast or far...</i>

131
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,720
<i>... you run.</i>

132
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,080
Ok, listen.
Tell him...

133
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,799
When we get back to Libitina, 
we're going to send help. Ok?

134
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,919
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait. You can't leave him.

135
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,080
What are you talking about?
He doesn't want our help.

136
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,399
But it's wrong.

137
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,759
It's wrong?!

138
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,080
He's got a gun.

139
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,399
Better in here 
than out there.

140
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
He's got a gun 
with one bullet.

141
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,000
Better than none.
