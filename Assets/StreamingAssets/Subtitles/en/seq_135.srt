1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,839
A beta like you can't have
risen very far in the army ranks.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:04,599
Beta?

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:06,519
You know 
what a beta is.

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,720
The opposite of alpha.
A follower, not a leader.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,919
Typical nice guy.

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,720
Yeah well, my nonna
taught me to be respectful.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,199
Yeah, I'm sure she did.

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,199
I bet she also taught you that
any girl would be lucky to have you.

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,000
Eurgh. Classic.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,600
Tell me about 
your last relationship.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Ok...

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,600
We met online.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,399
It started great.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,439
We were very different,
but opposites attract, right?

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,679
Then she started telling 
me about her past relationships.

16
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,079
How they treated her badly but 
that made her love them more.

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,359
... and that wasn't 
 a red flag to you.

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,799
I respected her past.

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,200
I wanted to be
different and treat her well.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,960
So, you just let her 
say and do whatever

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,640
she wanted, even though 
you didn't like it.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,359
I didn't want 
to ruin things.

23
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,159
How did it end?

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
She cheated on me.

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
- Many times.
- Voila.

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,920
Look, your nonna was right.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,239
A woman will settle 
for a beta guy.

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,120
Right after she's fucked a
bunch of big-dicked alphas.

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,359
- Hey, I helped you.
- Eurgh. Don't do that.

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,480
It's very unattractive.

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,040
Looking for gratitude 
is a prime beta move.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,239
It's weak.

33
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,879
What?

34
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,120
Say what you 
want to say.

35
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,519
I've been called it all.

36
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,719
A sociopath, a narcissist, 
a gaslighter.

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,920
A cunt?

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Hey, I got a confession.

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,840
What is it, Zanna?

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,079
Don't be weird.
It's not a Catholic thing.

41
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,480
I just need the toilet.

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,439
We just came 
from the farm.

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,239
So? It is what it is.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,439
Well, we can't go back.

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,879
We can go through the woods,
or there's an old military battery

46
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,840
with a proper toilet just beyond 
the perimeter, if you prefer.

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,159
All right, well, which one's 
on your nonna's route?

48
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,199
Well, she uses 
both, but uh,

49
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,759
it's best we 
don't split up.
