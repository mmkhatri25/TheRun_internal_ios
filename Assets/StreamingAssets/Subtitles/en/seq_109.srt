1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,120
His nonna better be 
Mother fucking Teresa.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:05,200
Matteo, wait!

3
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,119
[gasping]

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,679
<i>One new video message </i>
<i>from 'Clifford Hendricks'.</i>

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,759
Matteo, slow down a sec.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,320
- Zan!
- Hey Zanna!

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,679
So we are 
walking home.

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,200
I didn't get the tattoo in 
the end, but guess what?

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,679
I got this instead...

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,280
Sexy as fuck.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,159
Right?

12
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,320
So listen, I 
just wanna say -

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,719
I love you.

14
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,680
Even though I never get 
to see you anymore because

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,120
you're, I don't know, 
busy breaking the internet.

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,920
But...

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,239
... you deserve that success.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,439
- Tell her.
- You do, you really do.

19
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,159
- She does, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,439
Stay on the grind, sis!

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,760
Oh, and no hard feelings 
about the money.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,120
Tough love, like, I get it.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,719
[laughs]

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,079
Who's the party boy?

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,680
My brother, Cliff.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
He's one of those
unfalteringly positive people.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,719
You know the type.

28
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,680
He'll go far.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,159
... and you aren't positive?

30
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
No, I am when I 
need to be.

31
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,159
Come on, pick 
up the pace.

32
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,799
Your earphones stayed in?

33
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,480
Yeah, I forget they're 
in half the time.

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm the brand's ambassador.

35
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,319
I get five figures 
every time I say

36
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,120
they're the best sports 
earphones money can buy.

37
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,519
Nice.

38
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,439
Nonna!

39
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,840
What the fuck is 
wrong with you?!

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,639
You trying to 
get us killed?!

41
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,919
Sorry.
