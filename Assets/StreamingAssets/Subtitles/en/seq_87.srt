[slap impact]

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:01,639
Ow.

3
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,640
You shouldn't sneak 
up on people like that.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,080
Where's your key?!

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,320
There's no crime around here.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,879
What? So, how do 
you lock the doors?

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,280
- I don't.
- What?

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,839
Wanna tell me 
what's going on?

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,239
Yeah, I borrowed some 
of your wife's clothes.

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,600
[chuckles] 
My wife?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,399
Yeah, I didn't think 
she'd mind.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,839
Don't worry, your 
secret's safe with me.

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,600
No, those are 
my nonna's clothes.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
I told you about 
her this morning.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,079
Anyway, why would 
you need them?

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,079
Because mine made me
look like a big pink target.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
Where is your nonna?

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
She went for a run.

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,960
Matteo, I am running 
from three...

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
... now two... killers.

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,920
Killers?!
[chuckles]

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,600
Your nonna is 
in serious danger.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,719
Nothing bad ever 
happens out here.

24
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,840
Look, I don't know
what's going on either.

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,239
You want me to run into
the woods and leave you here alone.

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,840
What the fuck would I
steal from a farm, you idiot?!

27
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,519
Matteo!

28
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,680
Matteo, you have 
to believe me.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
Show me proof!

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Ah!

31
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,079
Just wait... 

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,159
<i>[screams]</i>

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
What are you doing? 
They're dangerous!

34
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,040
Matteo!

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
Listen to me.

36
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,319
Shit...

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,519
Inside.

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,280
Get inside!

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Hey!

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, come this way!

41
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,359
Shit!
